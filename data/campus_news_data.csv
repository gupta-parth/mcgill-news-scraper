Exposure to wildfires increases risk of cancer,"A new study from McGill University finds higher incidence of lung cancer and brain tumors in people exposed to wildfires. The study, which tracks over two million Canadians over a period of 20 years, is the first to examine how proximity to forest fires may influence cancer risk.“Wildfires tend to happen in the same locations each year, but we know very little about the long-term health effects of these events. Our study shows that living in close proximity to wildfires may increase the risk of certain cancers,” says Scott Weichenthal, an Associate Professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health at McGill University.Published in The Lancet Planetary Health, the study shows that people living within 50-kilometer of wildfires over the past 10 years had a 10 per cent higher incidence of brain tumours and 4.9 per cent higher incidence of lung cancer, compared to people living further away.Impacts of climate change on human healthWith the changing climate, wildfires are predicted to become more prevalent, severe, and longer in duration in the future – and they are increasingly recognized as a global health problem. “Many of the pollutants emitted by wildfires are known human carcinogens, suggesting that exposure could increase cancer risk in humans,” says Jill Korsiak, a PhD student in Weichenthal’s lab who led the analysis.Wildfires typically occur in similar regions each year, and as a result, people living in nearby communities might be exposed to carcinogenic wildfire pollutants on a chronic basis, warn the researchers.Lingering harmful pollutantsIn addition to impacts on air quality, wildfires also pollute aquatic, soil, and indoor environments. While some pollutants return to normal concentrations shortly after the fire has stopped burning, other chemicals might persist in the environment for long periods of time, including heavy metals and hydrocarbons. “Exposure to harmful environmental pollutants might continue beyond the period of active burning through several routes of exposure,” adds Weichenthal.Still, more research is necessary to understand the complex mixture of environmental pollutants released during wildfires, note the researchers. They also note that further work is needed to develop more long-term estimates of the chronic health effects of wildfires.","Wed, 05/11/2022 - 16:13"
Community spotlight: Celebrating a year of sustainability with the Environmental Residence Council,"From jumping into rigorous academics to learning to live on your own, the first year of university is not short on new experiences. Within McGill residence lies a student organization working to introduce incoming McGillians to yet another idea: sustainability.The Environmental Residence Council (ERC) is a student group working within McGill residences to promote sustainable practices through events, outreach, and campaigns. Each university residence has a representative on the ERC so that all students living on campus can voice concerns and participate in sustainable change.Jess Price, the current ERC Advisor is a second-year undergraduate student who began as a member of the council herself.  Her role is to act as a mentor and guide for incoming students on the council and assist young leaders in achieving their sustainable goals.“I started at McGill during the [COVID-19] lockdown and was struggling to find a community here. When I saw the opportunity to get involved with the council, I decided I’d give it a try,” said Price, “I got to meet like-minded people and connect with groups that I wouldn’t normally be able to. It was a really beneficial experience for me.”Providing a community for sustainability-oriented students Jess Price is the Environmental Residence Council AdvisorCourtesy of the Environmental Residence CouncilWith the goal of providing a community for new students and encouraging youth to advocate for sustainable change, the ERC has made its presence known on campus this year. From collaborating with other student organizers for Fair Trade Campus Week, clothing swaps, and workshops, this small but mighty group of incoming students is determined to make change. The group also hosted their first Go Green sustainable networking event where residents had the opportunity to connect to other student groups on campus working on sustainability.The largest success this year for the council was creating a Residence Sustainability Survey to better address the needs of students on sustainable topics, one Price was particularly passionate about.“We got great data about plant-based meal options, recycling and composting, and then we got to work with the McGill SDG Hub to understand students’ knowledge about sustainable development.”This information will help create systems to better serve students in the future, Price said.With the information from the survey, members of the ERC set out to create an information booklet and quizzes to give incoming students in future years the opportunity to learn about sustainability as soon as they step onto campus.“I can’t wait to look at the handbook once it comes out in August. The council worked really hard on this project, and I know it will help new students feel connected to sustainability at McGill right away. I’m very proud of what we’ve made, and I am so excited to see it at orientation!”Maintaining connectionsWith the pandemic still impacting students’ ability to connect, the work the ERC is doing may be more important – and challenging – than ever.“Getting students to engage, especially in the first semester, was really difficult,” Price admitted, “We were working almost entirely online still, and there was definitely some burnout from trying to connect remotely all of the time.  When you’re in a Zoom meeting, it is way more difficult to get everyone involved in the conversation, and even more difficult to make everyone feel comfortable.”Another challenge was maintaining connections on campus.“I think one of the positives was needing to lean more heavily on other groups to feel that community. ERC ended up fostering a better relationship with [the Office of Sustainability], for example, and now we have that stronger connection we can collaborate more in the future.”Despite the challenges, the ERC has created a space for students to band together and learn about campus through sustainability initiatives.“I’ve gotten to learn so much more about McGill as a school because I’ve been involved in sustainability,” Price reflected, “I’ve learned so much more about the university itself and all the amazing work being done everywhere to improve things.  It’s about more than just the environment, it’s about building community.”","Wed, 05/11/2022 - 15:30"

McGill’s carbon reduction strategy yields outstanding results,"“Adopting a more carbon-conscious investment approach complements McGill’s far-reaching climate change and sustainability goals as well as efforts to achieve carbon neutrality across the University’s operations,” says Principal Suzanne Fortier.Neale McDevitt As part of its ongoing commitment to fighting climate change, McGill University’s result-oriented strategy has accelerated the effective decarbonization of its investment, and further reduced its exposure to large users of oil, gas, and coal, as well as fossil fuel producers. By taking a holistic approach that looks beyond the traditional carbon-intensive energy sector, the University has achieved a nearly 53 per cent absolute reduction in the carbon footprint of its two-billion-dollar endowment portfolio in just two years.This is one of the many accomplishments included in the University’s 2021 Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) annual report issued this month by McGill’s Investment Committee. “McGill University’s bold strategy has reduced the carbon emissions of its endowment investments by 78,000 tons annually, which is equivalent to taking approximately 16,800 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles off the road,” said Sophie Leblanc, Chief Investment Officer & Treasurer at McGill University. “This is about four times more than what could have been accomplished by divesting from top oil and gas reserve owners alone.”McGill’s commitment to sustainability goes back several decades. As evidenced by the sustainability statements it has signed, the University is committed to helping shape a future in which humans can thrive in a way that respects the planet.“Adopting a more carbon-conscious investment approach complements McGill’s far-reaching climate change and sustainability goals as well as efforts to achieve carbon neutrality across the University’s operations,” concluded Principal Suzanne Fortier.Many targets close, some already reachedIn April 2020, McGill’s Board of Governors approved an eight-point implementation plan for how the University will decarbonize its endowment portfolio, based on recommendations put forth in the final report of the Committee to Advise on Matters of Social Responsibility (CAMSR).The 2021 SRI report tracks key accomplishments in implementing the CAMSR recommendations “across all asset classes, such as equities, fixed income, real estate, and infrastructure.”The University has reached its target of increasing Impact Investments to five per cent, including a commitment of US $25 million in a Global Renewable Energy Fund. In total, McGill has engaged more than $100 million in investments to help transition to a zero-emission economy, covering everything from renewables to electrified transport, carbon capture, and sustainable solutions. McGill has also increased its investments in fossil-fuel-free funds to $10.8 million – more than double the initial commitment made five years ago.Other highlights of the implementation status (as of Dec. 31, 2021) include:Decarbonization: From September 2019 to December 2021, the carbon emissions of the McGill Investment Pool (MIP) listed equity portfolio have decreased by approximately 53 per cent. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, this absolute reduction is equivalent to approximately 16,807 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year. The relative reduction of the MIP listed equity portfolio carbon emissions now stands at 30 per cent below benchmark, which puts the University very close to meeting its 2025 target of achieving a minimum of 33 per cent carbon emissions reduction of the MIP public equities (relative to the MIP public equities benchmark).Screening: There is now $10.8 M invested in fossil-fuel-free funds, up from $9.2M this time last year. This is more than double the University’s initial commitment of $5M.Engagement: In 2021, McGill appointed SHARE as its shareholder engagement service provider to engage with the MIP’s portfolio companies on climate-related issues. Through SHARE, McGill became one of the first members of the University Network for Investor Engagement (UNIE), a university-led initiative that amplifies the voices of shareholders in addressing the drivers of climate change. Throughout 2021, SHARE has engaged with 39 portfolio’s companies on topics such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable finance, and ensuring a just transition.Institutional leadership: Throughout 2021, the MIP’s responsible investment practices were shared with the McGill community and with other institutional investors, including foundations and universities. In April 2021, the Office of Investments hired a Governance, Compliance & ESG analyst to further support McGill’s eight SRI commitments and the development of enhanced SRI practices.The Office of Investment places critical focus on ESG integration when selecting investment management firms. As a result, 99 per cent of MIP assets are managed by managers who follow an ESG Policy or are signatories of the UNPRI. Only 70 per cent of assets were managed according to these principles in 2016.See the full progress report for more details.McGill investment policy praisedThe same week that McGill released its latest SRI report, the C.D. Howe Institute independent think-tank released its own report card for Canadian universities, noting that although divestment “can help to reduce the carbon footprint of a portfolio, it does not necessarily help to decarbonize the economy… and that carbon footprint-reduction targets must be carefully balanced, particularly as renewable energy technologies require significant amounts of fossil fuels in their production.”The C.D. Howe Institute report, called “Put to the Test: Ranking Canada’s Universities on Their Climate Change and Endowment Activities,” places McGill in the top five of 16 Canadian universities who signed the “Climate Charter for Canadian Universities” and have “made commitments to manage their assets while taking climate change into consideration.” The report singled out McGill as the only signatory to include climate-related targets directly in its investment policy.“One statement of investment policy stood out among the rest,” noted the report. “McGill University’s Statement of Investment Policy includes both its emissions-reductions targets and its targets for environmental impact investments. We would not expect to see all commitments expressly stated in investment policy statements, but, as we have noted, the gravity of climate change is such that it merits special mention.”","Tue, 05/10/2022 - 16:23"
Quebec using McGill lab to test wastewater for COVID-19,"The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos (center), with Vice-Principal (Research & Innovation) Martha Crago (left) and Prof. Dominic Frigon (right), praises the work being done at McGill to test wastewater for COVID-19Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Since the start of the pandemic, a lab on the fifth floor of the McGill’s McConnell Engineering Building has been testing sewage water for traces of the coronavirus. A typical wastewater sample can detect between 1 and 30 infected individuals – including asymptomatic ones – per 100,000 people. In addition, the wastewater test can be done for a fraction of the cost of individual testing: a wastewater test for 100,000 people costs about $500, while a single PCR test costs $50. The project is co-led by McGill civil engineering professor Dominic Frigon, along with and Peter Vanrolleghem from Laval University, building on their CentrEAU-COVID, a pilot project that monitored the spread of COVID in large urban areas of Quebec.  For the next year, the Quebec government will use the laboratory to perform widespread testing of wastewater to track the spread and concentration of COVID-19 in Montreal, Laval, Quebec City and the Outaouais region. Researchers mobilized earlyWhen COVID-19 began spreading in early 2020,  Frigon, and other wastewater researchers around the world, quickly seized upon the fact that the virus doesn’t only grow in the respiratory tracts of humans, but also in their intestinal tracts – and a patient can shed high concentrations of the virus in their urine and feces.  “That’s why you have some of the COVID-related symptoms that are related to intestinal problems,” Frigon said. “So we realized that using wastewater, we can get at a rapid snapshot of what is happening in the population in terms of viral circulation.” The operation initially received funding from McGill’s Interdisciplinary Initiative in Infection and Immunity (MI4). By the fall of 2020, Frigon’s lab received $1 million from the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologie (FRQNT), a para-governmental agency which provides funding for scientific research projects. They also lined up another $700,000 from two family foundations, the Trottier and Molson Foundations. CentrEAU-COVID launched its website at the end of 2020, using a colour-coded map to indicate the level of viral concentration one of four Quebec regions – Montreal, Laval, Quebec City, and the Lower St. Lawrence.  After the funding ran out in November 2021, the website was put on pause, but Frigon’s lab continued testing in McGill’s student residences. In the winter of 2022, the testing done at residences helped the administration get a better sense of the trajectory of the Omicron variant, and helped the University make adjustments to its COVID-19 strategy on campus. Omicron, journalists change the game When the Omicron variant began making its presence felt in December 2021, the demand for PCR tests overwhelmed testing centres. Daily case counts, long considered the benchmark for tracking the severity of the pandemic, shot to unprecedented levels, dwarfing earlier waves of the pandemic. Faced with the increased demand for testing, the Health Ministry decided that PCR tests would only be made available to priority populations, and not the general public. This move, however, meant that the daily case numbers would no longer be a truly reliable indicator of the reach of the virus. By then, journalists had started calling for wastewater testing for COVID-19 to become the new norm. “It was a case of journalists catching on to something we’ve known all along,” Frigon said. “The journalists were the ones who said, ‘well, you don’t have anymore data. Why not use wastewater?’ And so, it’s more on the political side that the Ministry got hit, and they said, ‘well, maybe we should revise our position. We can’t come up with answers anymore.’” In March, the Health Ministry and l’Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) formally entered into a one-year partnership with Frigon’s lab. Federal minister praises ‘lifesaving work’ On April 25, federal health minister Jean-Yves Duclos visited Frigon’s lab to view the wastewater testing process first-hand. “Your work is not only important now, but will continue in the short and longer term,” Duclos said following his tour of the lab. “COVID is not over, unfortunately. There’ll almost certainly be other forms of the pandemic to come.” The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos (left) and Civil Engineering Professor Dominic Frigon (right) tour wastewater testing facility at the McConnell Engineering BuildingOwen Egan / Joni Dufour In a tweet posted later that evening, Duclos went further, praising the work being done at the lab as “lifesaving work.” Since June 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada has been working with provincial and municipal governments and academic institutions to establish a pan-Canadian wastewater testing network.  “The Public Health Agency of Canada brought together all of these researchers and created four committees – to talk about sampling and wastewater analysis, variant detection and monitoring, epidemiology and monitoring, and a generic coordination committee,” Frigon says. “Essentially, they’re to generate discussion, to tackle issues that may arise.” Meanwhile, Frigon’s lab hopes to normalize other uses for wastewater testing. “For example, I’m working on antimicrobial resistance surveillance,” Frigon said. “We can monitor seasonal flu as well. It could be done to detect other diseases in the population.  “Or, when the next pandemic hits.”","Tue, 05/10/2022 - 16:14"

In conversation with 2022 Black Grad valedictorian Teresa Tolo,"Teresa Tolo is graduating with a major in Economics and a double minor in International Development and Management.On May 1, 2022, the fourth annual Black Grad celebrated the achievements of Black students in McGill’s Class of 2022. The daylong event included speeches from this year’s Black Grad valedictorians, outstanding students who have earned the respect of the peers who they represent through their strong academic performance, leadership and commitment to making the University – and the world – a better place.Teresa Tolo is one of this year’s two Black Grad valedictorians.“Having interned with the World Food Program in Panama last summer, and currently serving as director of contributions for the McGill International Review,” said Black Grad MC Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo in his introduction of Tolo, “our next valedictorian has just graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Major in Economics with a double minor in International Development and management.”As part of the Reporter’s Spring 2022 Convocation coverage, we spoke with Tolo.What degree are you graduating with?A Major in Economics and a double minor in International Development and Management.What is your hometown?This is always a tough question! I was born in Nairobi, Kenya and lived in 4 other countries (Uganda, Rwanda, Myanmar and Switzerland) before moving to Montreal, so I carry a bit of every place I’ve lived inside of me. An easier answer would be wherever my mom and my sister are, which is still Geneva, Switzerland, and is also where I completed high school.Why did you choose McGill?My path to McGill was a bit of a windy one. I was originally set on going to university in the U.S. and despite getting into several great schools, the lack of financial support for international students didn’t leave me with any great options. However, after seeing the more reasonable cost of tuition in Canada and hearing from people who had visited Montreal or studied at McGill from my high school, I thought it could be a great experience. Now I can confidently say I couldn’t have made a better decision! What are some of the highlights of your time as a McGill student?Living in Montreal has been great. From events like Igloofest in the winter to the opening up of pedestrian streets and terrasses in the summer, all the big and small joys of living in such a diverse, creative and dynamic city have made my time at McGill all the better. I’m very interested in food and cooking (follow my cooking account on instagram: @cookingwithteray!), so the range of restaurants, fresh produce markets and affordable specialty food stores is another great thing about the city. At school, getting to explore potential career interests and gaining transferable skills has definitely also been a highlight. I’ve worked for everything from Alumni Advancement, which gave me insight into fundraising and customer relations, to the Wellness Hub to Enrolment Services. Three favourite places on the downtown or Mac campus?Lower field is definitely up there because the minute the sun starts to come out in the Winter semester, everyone gets to sit back and take a break from the usual hustle and bustle of getting across campus. It’s also where the Open Air Pub (OAP) happens, which would definitely be my second favorite “place”, where I have nothing but great memories from. Third choice would definitely be Vinh’s Cafe in the RVC building. There’s nothing like a big hearty bowl of delicious pho to warm you up in the winter.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced during your time here, and how did you overcome them?As a lot of other students would probably agree, the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to remote learning was a difficult time, especially in the middle of what would have otherwise been the peak of my time at university. Coping with feelings such as fear and loneliness was far from how I saw myself experiencing my second year at McGill. To overcome this, I definitely had to re-orient my priorities towards my academic performance and mental health, and was able to push through with the support of my family and friends.I’ve also gradually overcome the need to please others and conform to what everyone else was doing by instead becoming comfortable expressing my personal convictions and my unique personality. The freedom and spaces that a city like Montreal offers for you to interact with like-minded individuals and discover things that interest you have helped me realize the beauty in staying true to my own values. Now I feel empowered to only surround myself with people who affirm me and explore my interests without fear of judgement. Tell us about the 2022 Class of Black graduates.Where do I start? Standing and giving my valedictorian speech at the Black Grad ceremony almost brought tears to my eyes as I looked around the room and noted all the incredible people in my graduating cohort. These are people who have excelled in their individual passions and dreams ranging from photography to philanthropy while maintaining their values, academic excellence and supporting each other in the process. Who or what will you miss most?I will definitely miss the different spaces and events on campus that brought the Black community together to discuss important issues facing our community, but also just to have a good time! Soul Food Friday is probably up there for a lot of people along with conferences like the Desautels African Business Initiative (DABI) and the MASS Africa Speaks event. Getting involved by either volunteering or being part of the executive planning of these events was always such a great opportunity to interact with such accomplished, intelligent and like-minded people. I’ll also miss all the incredible friends I’ve made along the way and professors who opened my mind to so many new ideas. What advice do you have for new students to McGill?I think it’s not only important to find a place where you fit on campus, but to mark your presence and create the meaningful change that YOU want to see! Although this shouldn’t come at the expense of your academic performance or wellbeing, don’t be afraid to put yourself out there and seek opportunities to learn and grow. Take advantage of the resources available at McGill through the Internship Office Network, Black Student Network and other departments that are there for the purpose of helping you succeed. Finally, particularly to Black students and those from other marginalized backgrounds, be confident in the fact that your achievements and ambition have earned you a rightful place at McGill and to know that you belong no matter what obstacles or limitations you might face.Do you have anything to add?This is only the beginning of the rest of our lives. The best is yet to come!","Fri, 05/06/2022 - 10:47"
4 Burning Questions for Peter J. Hotez,"Peter J. Hotez is an internationally recognized physician-scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine developmentAgapito Sanchez, Baylor College of Medicine On May 16, Peter J. Hotez, MD, PhD, will kick off Global Health Week, a signature event of McGill’s Bicentennial, with his talk COVID-19 Vaccines: Science vs Antiscience. Dr. Hotez is an internationally recognized physician-scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine development, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and Professor of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, where he is also the Co-director of the Texas Children’s Center for Vaccine Development.In February 2022, Dr. Hotez and his longtime collaborator Maria Elena Bottazzi, PhD, were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for their work to develop and distribute a low-cost COVID-19 vaccine to people of the world without patent limitation. Their vaccine, Corbevax, a recombinant protein sub-unit vaccine that uses a similar process to the Hepatitis B vaccine, recently received approval for emergency use in India and is being manufactured by a local company there, with plans to expand licensing to other undervaccinated countries in the near future. A fervent defender of science in the face of misinformation, Dr. Hotez is a regular guest on US news outlets and a prolific editorialist.Please visit our website to register for Dr. Hotez’s public lecture and to learn more about our full Global Health Week programming.COVID-19 vaccines became widely available over a year ago. Why has the world failed to adequately vaccinate those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)? The failure was relying exclusively on the multinational companies at the expense of the LMIC vaccine producers.  Had the global policymakers supported the LMICs that already produce recombinant protein vaccines, we would have achieved vaccine equity much faster and vaccines that were as safe and effective as new technology – MRNA, adenovirus, particle – vaccines.You developed a COVID-19 vaccine, Corbevax, with your colleague Maria Elena Bottazzi and team. What motivated your team to make it patent-free and available to companies in LMICs?The entire vaccine program at our Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development is designed to optimize equity by employing technologies that are already in place in LMICs. We do this for our parasitic disease vaccines – schistosomiasis, hookworm, Chagas disease – and for the last decade have taken a similar approach for SARS, MERS and now COVID-19.Fighting antiscience rhetoric is another battle you’ve long engaged in. Antiscience went mainstream in many countries during the pandemic. How did we get here?The anti-vaccine movement has evolved from small grassroots organizations that falsely believed vaccines caused autism,* into a political movement, and now one front and centre of a far right political agenda promoted by members of the US Congress House Freedom Caucus, and amplified nightly on Fox News, with academic cover from far right think tanks.  Those refusing vaccines are victims of anti-science aggression from these groups.  In my new book Antiscience Kills (JHU Press, forthcoming), I estimate that 200,000 unvaccinated Americans in 2021 needlessly lost their lives despite the widespread availability of vaccines.[* Editor’s Note: Dr. Hotez tackled the false claims about autism and vaccines in his book, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism: My Journey as a Vaccine Scientist, Pediatrician, and Autism Dad (JHU Press, 2020].Having worked on vaccines for a long time, how can we address the problem of vaccine hesitancy?We have to recognize that this is more than just an infodemic that requires realignment of social media computer algorithms. For the US (and now Canada and Western Europe) we need to address this as a political monster from far right authoritarian groups.Register for COVID-19 Vaccines: Science vs Antiscience with Peter J.

"Honoring the genius loci, 200 years of McGill’s Botanical history inspires Montreal artists","Artist’s rendering of the model for a public square to be built in Griffintown this July, designed by Marie-Michelle Deschamps. Reproduced with permission of the artist Two-hundred years ago, a young man frequented swamps, stream banks and thickets, collecting wild plants across what would become the urban core of the city of Montreal. He had recently returned home from Edinburgh, where he had gone to be receive medical training, learning there also techniques of drying and preserving plant specimens, botany and medicine then being sister-subjects.It was likely on his visits to friends and patients across the city that he did his collecting, often re-visiting the same spots on different dates, creating a catalog of flowers and fruits as they appeared through the seasons. Dr. Andrew Holmes would go on to help found Canada’s first medical school, the Montreal Medical Institution, which shortly after became the Faculty of Medicine in the freshly established McGill University.Holmes donated his plants to the McGill University Herbarium on its founding, and these have been cherished and preserved ever since. Although the earth of Montreal now holds up the buildings and industry of a metropolis, thanks to Holmes’ botanical record, the spirit of these last days of wilderness can still be pictured. Two public art projects launching in Montreal this summer take inspiration from this collection; sharing a goal to resonate this glimpse of the past into the present and through to the future.Hidden images appear as if by magicLoren Williams indicating on a historic map what the area that became parc La Fontaine looked like in the early 19th centuryIn search of the Papineau Woods, in the words of its creator, Loren Williams, “creates a conversation between an early woods and a present day urban park.” Ephemeral and playful, Williams’ vision was to instal on the walkways of Parc La Fontaine a series of paintings of the plants Holmes collected there. Made with waterproofing paint, the images emerge from the concrete with the addition of water. The changes introduced by the seasons, plant growth, weather, the movement of people, and of the paintings themselves into and out of view as they are wetted or dry, will create this alchemical chatter of varying compositions.She hopes some of her images will also appear by surprise to thirsty visitors to the park’s drinking fountains, or to soggy soccer players who have matches and practices rain or shine. Contextual information, and indications that there is a hidden image will also be installed in the park; plant images will be added through the summer, coinciding with the dates that Holmes collected them. Maps, which “form a portal to the history of a place” will be part of the information provided, showing past waterways of the park and the Papineau Woods and the Montreal Holmes once knew.Williams’ work also bridges the location’s ancestral floral diversity to its current vocation as green playground in an urban ocean. Many of the painted plants are no ghosts, and can also be found growing in the park, or are on the “to plant” list, thanks to the city’s horticultural team, who have been working with Williams to select species which could once again thrive in the varied growing conditions available in the park’s ponds and gardens.New public square in GriffintownHolmes’ youthful plant collecting jaunts about the city also provide a trellis for Marie-Michelle Deschamp’s winning design of a new public square. Various metal sculptures will make up the installation and will be installed by the City of Montreal this July in a redeveloped area in Griffintown near the canal.Striving to honour the past in a vision of the future, her final design reflects the importance of water, shipping and industry to the area and invites the visitor to contemplate its changing vegetation. Metal pipes will reference ductwork, the movement of water and echo the prominent architectural element of arches in the old industrial buildings. A large, cast milkweed fruit will float boat-like across the middle space of the square, Deschamps adding that it is also symbolic for being a “plant of the future”, as it can be used as insulation, is indigenous to Quebec, and can be sustainably grown here. A ribbon element will flow both like water and like a scrollwork of the sites botanical history, including images that Deschamps laser-cut into the metal of many other plant species that Holmes collected.Deschamps explained the evolution of her creation to me as emerging from a common experience of many people during the pandemic, which “made us look differently at nature.” Having gone many times to the area around Rimouski and Parc du Bic, where the primary features of the landscape are natural, Deschamps became familiar with the plants that grew there. Then, mostly restricted to the city in 2020, walking each day from her home to her studio through Villeray and across highway 40, she began to appreciate the plants of this very industrial space. The ability of nature to come through the layers of the city, and for many of the species she knew from the shores of the fleuve to find a home in a small crack in the concrete, was a marvel and an inspiration which informed her design for the square.Looking at and acknowledging the past, well also giving a view to the future, where indigenous plants can have a bigger role, both Deschamps and Williams share a vision in their work of closing a circle and creating a harmony between the ages that embraces both change and constancy.","Thu, 05/05/2022 - 15:48"

Elena Bennett elected to the National Academy of Sciences,"Elena Bennett has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). On May 3, the academy announced the election of 120 members and 30 international members “in recognition of their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.”Elena Bennett is jointly appointed in the Bieler School of Environment and the Department of Natural Resource Sciences.“McGill congratulates Elena Bennett on the prestigious honour of membership to the National Academy of Sciences, which is given to the most influential and innovative thought and research leaders in the world,” said Martha Crago, Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation. “As a scholar, Professor Bennett has made transformational contributions to the field of ecosystem ecology. As a knowledge mobilizer and community partner, her work serves to deepen understanding of the relationships between people and nature.”Membership to the NAS is a widely accepted mark of excellence in science and is considered one of the highest honours that a scientist can receive. Members include Albert Einstein, Margaret Mead, and Thomas Edison.Bennett becomes only the fourth member of McGill to be elected to the NAS, joining Brenda Milner, Vicky Kaspi and Nahum Sonenberg.“It is honestly thrilling and a little stunning to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences. It is an amazing honour,” said Bennett, who is jointly appointed in the Bieler School of Environment and the Department of Natural Resource Sciences. “While I think sometimes we picture award-winning scientists as brilliant loners spending long hours in the lab, my science is definitely the outcome of many inspiring and informative collaborations with colleagues, including especially all the amazing students I have lucky to work with over the years.”Healthy partnerships benefit allIt is fitting that Bennett praises teamwork and collaboration. A leading expert in ecosystems, Bennett understands the value of partnership and strong relationships.Research in the Bennett lab centres around questions about ecosystem services, and the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. Bennett’s areas of expertise include sustainable use and management of biodiversity and ecosystem services; multi-functional landscapes; human impacts on biogeochemical cycles; management of tradeoffs among ecosystem services, especially agricultural production and water quality; global food security, agriculture and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; land use change and water quality; and urban ecology.Bennett is also the founding director of NSERC ResNet, effectively an ecosystem of ecosystem experts. ResNet is a pan-Canadian network to improve management of working landscapes for the provision of multiple ecosystem services.Getting the word out thereIt has been a heady few weeks for Bennett. In April, she earned a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. “I’m thinking I probably should go out and buy a lottery ticket,” she joked.“I’m hoping to use this [NAS] honour, and the Guggenheim Fellowship, to ensure that the results of our work, and the knowledge generated, is in the hands of a wide audience, including all sorts of decision-makers and citizens,” she said.This kind of influence and positive impact is exactly why the NAS was formed.The NAS dates back to 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln signed a congressional charter forming the private, non-profit institution to provide the U.S. with a non-partisan council of scientific and technological leaders who could lend expertise and advice to the government. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership and, with the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Medicine, provides science, engineering and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.Read the National Academy of Sciences press release.","Thu, 05/05/2022 - 11:11"
"Black Grad celebrates accomplishment, and resilience","Celebrating Black Grad 2022Kojo Chang-Jones / Black Students NetworkBlack members of McGill’s Class of 2022 celebrated the completion of their degrees at the fourth annual Black Grad event on Sunday, May 1 at the Omni Hotel in downtown Montreal. For the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, graduating students were able to mark the event with their friends, families and professors in person.The event, which took its inspiration from similar events at Harvard, Yale and the University of Toronto, honours graduating students ahead of next month’s Convocation – and highlights their accomplishments despite the institutional, economic and socio-cultural barriers to accessing higher education.Hosted by Black Student Affairs Liaison Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo, the event featured a roster of speakers and musical guests, and for the first time, included a semi-formal gala, dinner and awards ceremony, and an opportunity for the new graduates to network with representatives from companies such as RBC, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley.“Statistically speaking, we are less represented in academia, so to have this kind of event where we all come together with faculty members with leaders and industries that we might want to go and work into, it’s just really all about inspiration and knowing that we did it, and that we can do so much more,” said Marie-Perle Nkosi, VP Finance of the Black Students Network (BSN) and one of the organizers of the event. “To know that I will be part of making this day special for graduating students and faculty members – that really is the essence of the event.”Succeeding during a pandemicKeynote speaker Che BirchwoodKojo Chang-Jones / Black Students’ Network Many of the speakers made a point of congratulating the students not just for earning a degree, but doing so in the middle of a global pandemic, with unprecedented challenges and obstacles.In the keynote address, community educator Che Birchwood reminded students of the magnitude of their accomplishments. “University was already hard on students, so the pandemic was like throwing gas on a fire,” Birchwood said.Birchwood recently completed their PhD at Université de Montréal in 2021, studying the mental health challenges university students face. They found that seven per cent of students surveyed in the fall of 2020 by l’Université de Montréal had entertained suicidal thoughts, while three per cent attempted suicide – both roughly double the pre-pandemic figures. They also noted that the rate of depression among students was 20 per cent higher than before the pandemic.“The situation for students is rough,” Birchwood told the audience, “but that makes your graduation more impressive. You did something that’s already difficult, and in some of the worst conditions possible, so congratulate yourselves double-time.”Progress made on Anti-Black Racism Action PlanIn 2020, the University launched its ambitious five-year Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism (AP-ABR). Black Grad speakers touted the University’s progress toward meeting targets such as increasing academic and psychological support for Black students, and increasing the numbers of Black tenure-track faculty members by 40 in three years.“We are very dedicated in our office to make sure we meet those targets to make McGill a welcoming place for more Black students and more Black faculty,” said Provost Christopher Manfredi. “So that when you go out into the world, you can tell people that McGill is somewhere they should be.”“One of the reasons why you need to stay connected to McGill is to keep us all accountable,” said Terri Givens, Professor in the Department of Political Science and the Provost’s Acacemic Lead and Advisor on the AP-ABR. “Because you are the ones who are going out in the world, and we want you to help us to make sure we keep that pipeline going, that we keep more and more Black students coming to McGill. Not only that they come to McGill, but that they feel welcome. That they see themselves in the classroom. That representation is important.”Using privilege for goodYolande E. Chan, who joined the Desautels Faculty of Management as McGill University’s first Black Dean in 2021, told the grads that their education carries a significant amount of responsibility. She pointed to the story of Viola Desmond, the Black Nova Scotia woman who now adorns the Canadian $10 bill. Desmond was removed from a movie theatre in 1946 for sitting in a whites-only section, issuing a challenge to segregation and racism in Canada nearly a decade before Rosa Parks’ iconic act of defiance on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.“What you may not know is that Viola literally went out of her way to be educated, travelling to cities in the U.S. and Canada, including Montreal, to train to be a beautician,” Chan said. “She then turned around and opened the Desmond School of Beauty Culture to educate other Black women. Her students were encouraged to open businesses to provide jobs for still other Black women. She gave back.“When we look at Viola Desmond’s story, it’s clear that life is not primarily about comfort. It’s about recognizing where you and I have advantages where we’re privileged, and using these privileges to give opportunities to others, and living courageously, boldly. And every one of us is writing a story like Viola’s, or even like mine. A little page of history.”Award winnersFourth-year medical student Victoire Kpadé was honoured as the recipient of the first Cadet Foundation Award, a bursary established by alumnus Nicolas Cadet (MDCM’12) with the goal of assisting Black medical students and increasing the presence of Black medical personnel. A former Quebec Regional Director for the Black Medical Students’ Association, Kpadé is also the co-founder of the Refugee Health Initiative at McGill, aimed at reducing barriers faced by refugees and asylum seekers and training medical students on cultural competency.Meanwhile, Edourarda Taguedong and Antoney Bell were named winners of the Audrea Golding Black Student Leadership Award, which celebrates graduating Black students who have demonstrated extraordinary community leadership.Other award winners announced during the evening’s gala were:Entrepreneurship: Lens Harry Louis – Founder of Recovery Inc., an injury recovery system used by various athletic teams and physiotherapistsInnovation: Bryana Jean-Jacques – Founder and President of the first CBNA (Canadian Black Nurse Alliance) Chapter at McGillCommunity Engagement: Anne-Clara Sanon – Founder and President of Girls for Ghana, a non-profit club at McGill that raises money to fund girls’ educationAthletics: Quarry Whyne – Co-captain of the McGill basketball teamPerforming Arts: Nicolas Beaulne –Bachelor of Commerce, who also planned dance classes for black students during his tenure as BSN’s Project ManagerLeadership: Jemark Earle – One of the first Black presidents at the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU) and leader in student lifeValedictorians stress unityValedictorian Teresa Tolo Kojo Chang-Jones / Black Students’ Network The event included speeches by valedictorians Teresa Tolo (Bachelor of Arts, major in Economics with a double minor in International Development and Management) and Jemark Earle (Bachelor of Civil Law and Juris Doctor).In her speech, Tolo stressed the need for Black people to pull together to help achieve people’s individual goals as a collective.“I originally come from Kenya, and one of our central values of our culture is the idea of harambe – everyone coming together to achieve a common goal. I think in our context of our experience as a Black community, and soon-to-be McGill alumni, I see this as a way that we can come together to support, uplift, and empower each other, while reaffirming our identity and our values. Simple things like sharing your friend’s hair-braiding page on your Instagram story, or referring someone in your LinkedIn network for a job. The potential for all of us to succeed by supporting one another became very clear.”She closed with a quote from former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama.“When you’ve worked hard and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you don’t slam it shut for people behind you, you reach back and you give other people the same chances that helped you succeed.”Valedictorian Jemark Earle Kojo Chang-Jones / Black Students’ Network Earle, a former SSMU president, praised the ability of Black students to band together to create change, and also urged members of the Class of 2022 to act as mentors for young people.“Black students are capable of creating change and mobilizing,” Earle said. “I’ve seen first-hand the change that has occurred because of the relentless advocacy of the black community. Continuously champion the opportunity to make change, and provide resources and support to other marginalized students,” Earle said.Earle ended his speech with a quote from former U.S. President Barack Obama.“Change will never come if we wait for some other person or some other time.

SciArt200 winners announced,"Kate Sheridan, a McGill doctoral student in biology, has been awarded the SciArt200 jury’s grand prize for their artwork Isopod field jacket, a crocheted item of clothing they contributed to the special art exhibit organized by the Faculty of Science in honour of the University’s bicentenary.The judges selected a total of seven artworks for distinction, awarding prizes in the following categories:Grand prize – $350Kate Sheridan – Isopod field jacket (crocheted jacket)Traditional media – two awards of $250Nicole Ford – Field Lines (linocut with ink on paper)Keisha Carter – Induce, Love, Rapture (Oxytocin) (acrylic)Digital photography – two awards of $250José Bustamante – SolidaritySarah Ford – Pileated WoodpeckerDigital modeling – one award of $250Timothy Thomasson and Benjamin Keenan – Visualizing the ancient Maya and their environmentHonourable mention – one award of $150Celeste Groux – A look at the universe (beadwork)Art and science inform each otherHand stitched from a blend of super fine alpaca and Peruvian wool, the prize-winning work took around 100 hours to complete, with Sheridan admitting that some portion of that time may have coincided with their participation in one or more Zoom meetings. Depicting a giant isopod – a crustacean the artist counts among their favourite sea creatures – the jacket not only impressed the SciArt200 judges, but also kept its creator warm and dry during long hours of field work investigating changes in marine communities.“For me, art and science have always been inseparable. They inform and feed each other,” Sheridan says. “Last fall, I collected marine water samples off the coast of British Columbia, and I needed a warm wool jacket, but couldn’t find one that met my needs. So, I made one.”SciArt200 judges Gwendolyn Owens (Director of McGill’s Visual Art Collection), David Covo (Associate Professor, McGill School of Architecture) and Gérald Cadet (McGill Bicentennial Director) said they “enjoyed the opportunity to participate in this very imaginative celebration of art” and expressed the hope that there may be future editions.About SciArt200To mark the University’s Bicentennial, the Faculty of Science called on artists from across the McGill community to submit works in any medium, expressing what science meant to them. Curated by McGill’s then Climate Change Artist in Residence, Milton Riaño, an interactive online exhibition of this stunningly diverse collection of 65 artworks opened to the public on December 13, 2021, and remains open for visitors to enjoy.Explore the SciArt200 virtual galleryImage 1 of 7Kate Sheridan – Isopod field jacket (crocheted jacket)Image 2 of 7José Bustamante – SolidarityImage 3 of 7Keisha Carter – Induce, Love, Rapture (Oxytocin) (acrylic)Image 4 of 7Nicole Ford – Field Lines (linocut with ink on paper)Image 5 of 7Sarah Ford – Pileated WoodpeckerImage 6 of 7Timothy Thomasson and Benjamin Keenan – Visualizing the ancient Maya and their environmentImage 7 of 7Celeste Groux – A look at the universe (beadwork)PreviousNext","Wed, 05/04/2022 - 16:17"
In conversation with 2022 Black Grad valedictorian Jemark Earle,"Jemark Earle is graduating with a B.C.L & J.D (Bachelor of Civil Law and Juris Doctor)On May 1, 2022, the fourth annual Black Grad celebrated the achievements of Black students in McGill’s Class of 2022. The daylong event included speeches from this year’s Black Grad valedictorians, outstanding students who have earned the respect of the peers who they represent through their strong academic performance, leadership and commitment to making the University – and the world – a better place.Jemark Earle is one of this year’s two Black Grad valedictorians.“This valedictorian has a unique path,” said Black Grad MC  Antoine-Samuel Mauffette-Alavo when he introduced Earle, “graduating with a Bachelors’ degree in Music before graduating today with his Bachelor of Civil Law. I first met him when he was President of the Student Society of McGill University.”As part of the Reporter’s Spring 2022 Convocation coverage, we spoke with Earle.What degree are you graduating with?I am graduating with a B.C.L & J.D (Bachelor of Civil Law and Juris Doctor)What is your hometown?I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario.Why did you choose McGill?I completed my Bachelor of Music at McGill in 2018 so returning to this university for law school was an obvious choice for me. I had fallen in love with the city of Montreal, and I was not ready to leave after my undergrad. Additionally, I wanted the opportunity to continue my studies in both English and French and to learn about the law through the lens of the common law and the civil law.What are some of your highlights of your time as a McGill student?It is hard to narrow it down because there are so many. If I had to pick three, they would be:Receiving my civil code from Dean Robert Leckey on the first day of Law SchoolAttending the Black Law Students’ Association of Canada’s national conference in VancouverSubmitting my final paper as a university studentThree favourite places on the downtown or Mac campus?Seeing all the students emerge on Lower Field on the first day of the year with nice weather.Thomson House’s Terrasse in the summer.Watching Concerts at Pollack Hall in the Schulich School of Music.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced during your time here and how did you overcome them?The biggest challenge for me was my first year of law school. It was a completely new way to learn and be evaluated on midterms and exams and I was in way over my head. Going to my professors’ office hours and speaking with upper-year students who had similar experiences played a big role in overcoming these challenges, but I ultimately would not have been able to succeed if it was not for the endless support I received from my mom.Tell us about the 2022 Class of Black GraduatesThe Class of 2022 Black Graduates have continuously championed the opportunity to make change, provide resources and support to other marginalized students. Their activism has left its mark at McGill will forever be memorialized through events like Black Grad and McGill’s Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism.Who or what will you miss most?I will miss participating in Frosh (as a first-year and as a Frosh leader). I will miss the Law Students Association’s Coffeehouse, the long lines at Open Air Pub and the Black Students’ Network’s Soul Food Fridays. I will miss the collective panic as everyone scrambles to register for classes on the first day of course registration. I will miss all of my professors who had an impactful role on my professional growth – Peter Freeman & Professor Adelle Blackett. Lastly, I will miss all of the friendships I have made during my time at McGill. I am incredibly proud to have this institution as my alma mater and I look forward to keeping up to date with everyone’s future successes.What advice do you have for new students to McGill?Get involved! Whether you join a club, your faculty’s student association, an intramural sport, or a community organization in the broader Montreal community, get involved! Academics are certainly important but your time at university should not only be spent studying on the 6th floor of McLennan Library 24/7. Getting involved will enable you to meet so many people and plan and attend so many wonderful events that will help facilitate new friendships and new bonds that will give you memories that will last a lifetime.Do you have anything to add?Don’t forget to give back to the community! If an upper-year student or alumni helped you when you were in your first year, try and do the same when you reach that stage in life. Even the smallest act of paying it forward will have a significant impact on someone else’s life.","Tue, 05/03/2022 - 14:14"
McGill researchers share their knowledge as a service to society,"Principal Suzanne Fortier announces the 2022 winners of the Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through Media at the Faculty ClubOwen Egan / Joni Dufour Whether it was by creating access to self-care, working to eliminate stigma in women’s health, or providing thoughtful commentary on topics ranging from the spread of COVID-19 to how the government spends its money, McGill researchers have once again gone above and beyond to share their knowledge and be of service to society this academic year.Principal and Vice-Chancellor Suzanne Fortier has announced the 2022 winners of the Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through Media. The prize was created six years ago to recognize exceptional scholars from across academic fields who share their knowledge with the media and the public. The competition, in which awards are given to individuals and groups at all stages in their academic careers, underlines the University’s commitment to public-facing scholarship.“I know [working with the media] takes time away from your time and your service to the university, but it’s important,” said Principal Fortier at the award ceremony on April 29 at the McGill Faculty Club. “I congratulate you, but mostly, I thank you.”There were 87 applications across categories this year. Those of us who work in the Media Relations Office know the number of requests coming from media for McGill experts remains high. We appreciate that there are many others across the university who didn’t apply for the prize this year, but who have consistently and generously responded to these requests.Working to eliminate stigma in women’s healthThe winner of this year’s Prize for Groups is Medical Herstory, an organization that works to eliminate sexism, shame and stigma from women’s health experiences through storytelling, medical education, and patient advocacy. The jury was impressed by the many techniques and platforms the group used for exchanges on topics relating to women’s health.The runners-up were Brain Reach, who work with large numbers of volunteers to inspire a love of science and neuroscience in particular in students of all ages and at all stages, and Sex[M]ed, whose mission is to provide comprehensive, inclusive, and diverse sexual health education to healthcare practitioners and trainees.The self-care spotlightThe number of applicants for the Prize for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Fellows grew significantly this year, with a total of 38 applications – the highest number ever.This year’s prize is awarded to Stephanie Zito, a PhD candidate in the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology who, building from her own experiences of anxiety during the pandemic, created the self-care spotlight to share evidence-based information, mainly through social media, about healthy coping mechanisms with students and schools.“It feels great to be recognized for an initiative that not only aims to bridge the gap between research and the public but also de-stigmatizes talking about mental health openly and honestly,” said Zito.As runners-up, the jury chose Alexandre Grant, a master’s student in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology who has dedicated himself to supporting and educating rare disease patients on their conditions, and Anais Remili, a postdoctoral candidate in the Department of Natural Resource Sciences who launched a science communication platform, Whale Scientists, to give early-career marine mammalogists a voice and allow them to share their knowledge with an international audienceCOVID-19 and childrenJesse Papenburg, Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics wins the Prize for Emerging Researchers. His ongoing presence in social and traditional media has provided the public with information on the science behind COVID-19 and the uncertainties of school attendance for children.“For the past two years, as a pediatric infectious disease specialist, it just seems like there’s been no end to the amount of work that I could do,” said Papenburg. “To have this external recognition, I’m very grateful.”The runners-up were Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey, Assistant Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies, who is compelled by the persistence of race-based inequities to share his expertise with the public in the hopes of inspiring change, and Ananya Banerjee, Assistant Professor, Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, who highlighted the ongoing structural racism and health inequities among marginalized groups in Canada and globally.Political perspectivesThe winner of the Prize for Established Academics is Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, in the Department of Political Science and Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada. In choosing him as the winner, the jury underlined his extensive presence in local, national and international media. They noted that Béland presented well-informed views about a wide range of political topics – from the federal budget to the trucker convoy in Ottawa – in a thorough and accessible way.The runners-up in the category this year were Parisa Ariya, Full Professor in Departments of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Chemistry, who shared important information about aerosol transmission and pandemic management, Catherine Hankins, Full Professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health who co-chaired Canada’s COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, and Taylor Owen, Associate Professor, Max Bell School of Public Policy, who built the Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy.Our 2022 Changemaker: Cindy BlackstockThe Changemaker Prize is one for which you cannot apply but must be nominated and is awarded on an occasional basis to individuals whose dedication to sharing their knowledge with the media and the public has had a major impact on society. Professor Cindy Blackstock is our 2022 Changemaker.Professor Blackstock is a Full Professor in the School of Social Work. Her dedication and outstanding work with media over the past years has drawn attention to the systemic inequities faced by Indigenous children. She is committed to the idea that education lies at the heart of reconciliation, and her media work has played and important role in effecting important changes in policy, most notably in relation to this year’s $40 billion federal settlement for Indigenous welfare.“What a privilege it’s been to work in the company of the collective of the ancestors and in light of  the spirits of the children in the unmarked graves, who left us a legacy to do the work to ensure this is a generation of First Nations children who don’t have to recover from their childhoods,” said Blackstock. “That is not the work of one person; it is indeed the work of a country.”Read the press release.Image 1 of 62022 Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through MediaPhoto: Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Daniel Béland (seated right), winner of the Prize for Established Academics, shares a laugh with Principal Suzanne Fortier and Louis Arseneault, Vice-Principal (Communications and External Relations)Image 2 of 62022 Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through MediaPhoto: Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Cindy Blackstock, winner of the Changemaker Prize Image 3 of 62022 Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through MediaPhoto: Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Jesse Papenburg, winner of the Prize for Emerging ResearchersImage 4 of 62022 Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through MediaPhoto: Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Principal Suzanne Fortier and Louis Arseneault, Vice-Principal (Communications and External Relations) with with Olivia Marotta (black mask) and Emma Margie from Medical Herstory, winner of the Prize for GroupsImage 5 of 62022 Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through MediaPhoto: Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Anais Remili (centre), runner-up for the  Prize for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Fellows, is flanked by Principal Suzanne Fortier (left) and Anja Geitmann, Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental SciencesImage 6 of 62022 Principal’s Prize for Public Engagement through MediaPhoto: Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Principal Suzanne Fortier addresses the audience PreviousNext","Tue, 05/03/2022 - 09:32"
Impact Rankings highlights McGill’s commitment to sustainability,"Times Higher Education (THE) released the fourth edition of its Impact Rankings, which measure how institutions are delivering against the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). McGill had a strong showing in a number of SDGs, ranking in the top 100 worldwide in four of the 17 SDGs. In total, 1,406 universities representing 106 countries are ranked for at least one of the SDGs, an increase of 26.1 per cent over last year. The Impact Rankings measure the extent to which universities are having a positive environmental, social and economic impact on the planet. It is the first university ranking to use these criteria, rather than traditional metrics, such as reputation and research prestige. Carefully calibrated indicators are used to provide comprehensive comparisons across four broad areas: research, outreach, teaching and stewardship. Since the Impact Rankings inception in 2019, McGill has placed among the top 101-200 of participating institutions in all four years.This year, McGill had its best results in the following SDGs:  Climate Action (20th) This explores universities’ research on climate change, their use of energy and their preparations for dealing with the consequences of climate change. Zero Hunger (56th)This measures universities’ research on hunger, their teaching on food sustainability and their commitment to tackle food waste and address hunger among students and local communities.Life on Land (82nd) This measures universities’ research on life on land and their education on and support for land ecosystems.Partnerships for the Goals (94th) This measure looks at the broader ways in which universities support the SDGs through collaboration with other countries, promotion of best practices and publication of data.There are 17 SDGs, which were adopted by the UN in 2015 to provide a framework for developing the world in a sustainable way. These include ending poverty and hunger; promoting good health and well-being and quality education; achieving gender equality and economic growth; providing access to clean water and sanitation and affordable and clean energy; fostering innovation; reducing inequalities; building sustainable cities and communities and achieving responsible consumption and production; tackling climate change; managing sustainably life below water and life on land; promoting peaceful societies; and revitalizing global partnerships.

Making data science accessible to all,"If you follow science news, you will almost certainly have encountered the term ‘modelling’. From understanding climate change, to predicting the course of a pandemic, to developing the pharmaceuticals to fight one, scientists seem to have a ‘model’ for everything. But have you ever wondered just what the term means and how scientists go about creating models?The answer almost invariably involves using computers to work with enormous amounts of data. Data can be anything you can imagine – weather records, public health statistics, genetic sequences. In the digital age, our capacity to capture and store data has grown exponentially and with it has grown the potential for researchers to extract meaningful insights from these vast datasets.“More and more disciplines, not just in [natural] science but social science as well, are becoming more data-intense. There are more datasets, the datasets are bigger, and they are changing more rapidly over time,” says Tim Elrick, Ph.D., who has been teaching data science to McGill students for the past five years.A new initiative to serve a growing needDrawing on his experience as director of McGill’s Geographic Information Centre, Elrick is now delivering workshops in data science and statistics through the Computational and Data Systems Initiative (CDSI), a new facility to help McGill researchers access tools, techniques and expertise for working with large quantities of data. The CDSI is a product of the Faculty of Science’s strategic research plan, a plan which contains several initiatives broadly aimed at bringing communities of researchers with diverse disciplinary expertise together to work on complex problems.The CDSI works by drawing on the expertise in working with large datasets that traditionally resides in statistics and computer science departments and making it available to researchers in other disciplines through cross-disciplinary research and training. And, as noted in a white paper on the CDSI, there is opportunity for knowledge to flow in the other direction, too: “Computer science and statistics core researchers can benefit from contact with new applications as this exposes them to the many challenges that arise from working on problems at the forefront of research.”Training workshops well receivedSince the CDSI began delivering data science training workshops in fall 2021, there has been strong interest from across the McGill campus. So far, more than half the workshop participants have come from faculties other than Science, including the faculties of Arts, Medicine & Health Sciences, Agricultural & Environmental Sciences, and Dental Medicine & Oral Health Sciences.Isha Gandhi, a master’s student in dental sciences who attended every single one of the CDSI workshops offered in fall 2021, says she was able to build on her existing knowledge of the statistical programming language, R, as well as acquire new skills in Python. Gandhi has since been able to apply this knowledge to her master’s project on chronic pain.“I have learned new codes and commands for analyzing and visualizing data, which I have found super interesting and helpful for my project,” she says. “I am applying code script which I learned in the workshop to make my graphs more detailed.”Learn more about upcoming CDSI workshopsTailored consulting service coming soonThe CDSI has continued to offer workshops throughout the winter 2022 semester, expanding the lineup to include training streams in both data science and statistics. Meanwhile, the CDSI team has also been moving forward with the development of a consulting service to provide McGill researchers with customized advice on applied statistics, computing methodologies and data analytics, both for ongoing research and at the grant proposal stage. Co-directed by Elrick and José Correa, Ph.D., this new service, named the Consulting Core Facility, will build on the existing strengths of McGill’s Statistical Consulting Service, currently located in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics.To learn more about what the Computational and Data Systems Initiative can do for you, head to the CDSI website.","Mon, 05/02/2022 - 14:20"
Changes to COVID protocols | Modifications à l’égard des protocoles anti-COVID,"Christopher Buddle | 2 May 2022            Campus updates Add to calendarFacebookLinkedInTweet Widget This message is sent on behalf of Christopher Buddle, Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs), and Fabrice Labeau, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), on behalf of the Recovery and Operations Resumption Committee (ROR). Le présent message est envoyé au nom de Christopher Buddle, vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Enseignement et programmes d’études), et de Fabrice Labeau, premier vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Études et vie étudiante), au nom du Comité de la reprise des activités et du retour (RAR). La version française suit. Dear members of the McGill community, Although the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, we as a society have learned a lot about how to live with the virus and manage our individual risk. As we come to the end of the Winter 2022 semester, we are in a very different place than we were in March 2020 or at the beginning of the initial Omicron wave. As a result, the Recovery and Operations Resumption Committee (ROR) has demobilized. Naturally, if circumstances change to require central management of pandemic measures, we will mobilize the necessary structures and committees. Today, we wanted to let you know what will be happening over the next few weeks as we wind down central oversight of COVID protocols: 1) Masks will not be obligatory at McGill as of May 24, approximately one week after the Quebec government lifts its mask mandate.We still strongly encourage you to continue to wear a mask after May 24.Mask dispensers and hand sanitizers will remain in place for the coming months.If the Quebec government decides to delay its timeline for making masks optional, we may adapt our approach.We will continue to follow other public health measures as required by the government. 2) McGill’s Case Management Group (CMG) demobilized at the end of this term.An automated message providing information to callers will remain in place until 24 May.McGill will stop publishing data on its case tracking and dashboard webpages, effective immediately.The Rapid Testing project in student residences has been wrapped up as well.The CMG staff have done outstanding work since the Group was put in place nearly two years ago. We want to thank them for their dedication and expertise. 3) Administrative and Support Staff working from home are expected to return to the workplace for 100% of their time as of May 30.The Interim Flexible Work Arrangement (IFWA) will be in place as of that time.Eligible employees who are interested in the program are encouraged to talk with their supervisor. An automated application process will be made available via the IFWA website during the week of May 16.Additional information regarding the IFWA process will be forthcoming from HR. 4) Most information on McGill’s coronavirus site will be archived by May 24.The home page will continue to provide any key information and links to necessary resources, such as information from the Quebec government.The COVID Information email will also be deactivated. Thank you for the efforts you have made to keep our community safe throughout what we hope was the worst of the pandemic. You’ve endured 189 emails from the central administration related to the pandemic since January 2020. We hope (and we know many of you share this sentiment) that this will be the last message from us on this topic for a long time. We look forward to seeing you on campus, and while there are challenges ahead, we are optimistic about the coming weeks and months.  Christopher Buddle	Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs)Fabrice Labeau	Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning)  Chers membres de la communauté mcgilloise, La pandémie n’est pas terminée, mais nous avons appris, collectivement, à côtoyer le virus de la COVID-19 et, individuellement, à gérer notre risque. Les choses ont donc bien évolué entre mars 2020, le début de la vague Omicron et cette fin de la session d’hiver 2022. Aussi avons-nous décidé de démobiliser le Comité de la reprise des activités et du retour (RAR). Il va sans dire que si une gestion centralisée de la pandémie devait s’imposer de nouveau, nous remettrions en place les structures et les comités requis. Vous trouverez ci-après un aperçu des quelques semaines à venir, pendant lesquelles nous mettrons fin progressivement à la surveillance centralisée des protocoles anti-COVID. 1) Le port du masque ne sera plus obligatoire à compter du 24 mai, soit environ une semaine après la levée de cette consigne au Québec.Néanmoins, nous vous encourageons fortement à continuer de porter le masque après le 24 mai.Les distributeurs de masques et les désinfectants pour les mains vont rester en place au cours des mois à venir.Si Québec décidait de reporter la levée du port du masque obligatoire, nous pourrions revoir les consignes de notre côté également.Nous continuerons de suivre les autres mesures de santé publique, conformément aux consignes gouvernementales. 2) Le Groupe de gestion des cas de l’Université sera démobilisé à la fin de la présente session.Jusqu’au 24 mai, les personnes qui appellent le Groupe entendront un message informatif automatique.L’Université cesse dès maintenant d’actualiser ses pages Web « Bilan des cas de COVID-19 » et « Tableau de bord ».Le projet pilote de dépistage rapide dans les résidences étudiantes est également terminé.Le Groupe de gestion des cas a accompli un travail remarquable depuis sa mise en place, il y a près de deux ans. Nous remercions toute l’équipe pour sa compétence et son dévouement. 3) À compter du 30 mai, les membres du personnel administratif et de soutien qui sont en télétravail devront effectuer la totalité de leurs heures de travail au bureau.Le Régime de travail flexible intérimaire sera en vigueur à compter de cette date.Nous invitons les employés admissibles qui désirent s’en prévaloir à en discuter avec leur supérieur. Au cours de la semaine du 16 mai, le personnel pourra consulter le site du Régime de travail flexible intérimaire afin d’accéder au processus automatisé de soumission de demande.De plus amples renseignements sur le Régime de travail flexible intérimaire vous seront transmis prochainement par les Ressources humaines. 4) L’essentiel de l’information contenue sur le site de McGill consacré au coronavirus sera archivé d’ici au 24 mai.La page d’accueil demeurera active; elle renfermera des renseignements importants sur le coronavirus et des liens vers diverses ressources, notamment l’information du gouvernement du Québec.L’adresse de courriel COVID-19.info [at] mcgill.ca sera, elle aussi, désactivée. Je vous remercie d’avoir fait ce qu’il fallait pour protéger notre communauté pendant ce qui a été, espérons-le, le pire de la pandémie. La direction de l’Université vous a fait parvenir pas moins de 189 courriels sur la pandémie depuis janvier 2020. Souhaitons que le prochain ne vous arrive pas de sitôt (je sais que c’est un souhait partagé par bon nombre d’entre vous). Bien que nous ne soyons pas encore sortis de l’auberge, nous envisageons les semaines et les mois à venir avec optimisme. Au plaisir de vous voir sur nos campus,  Christopher Buddle	Vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Enseignement et programmes d’études)Fabrice Labeau	Premier vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Études et vie étudiante)","Mon, 05/02/2022 - 12:07"
"Prime Minister Trudeau, Premier Legault visit campus to welcome Moderna to Montreal","McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier (right) escorts Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (left) and Premier François Legault on a tour of McGill’s RNA research labs. (Photo: Owen Egan/Joni Dufour)On the morning of Friday, April 29, 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier François Legault joined Principal Suzanne Fortier in the lobby of the Bellini Building on McGill’s downtown campus. The trio had gathered to make a historic announcement: U.S.-based COVID-19 vaccine developer Moderna will build a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in the Montreal area to produce made-in-Canada messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, as well as vaccines for influenzas and other illnesses.As home to more than 100 internationally recognized scientists researching genomics and RNA investigation, McGill is a driving force in Montreal’s vibrant biomanufacturing innovation ecosystem. The addition of the new Moderna facility will help Montreal deepen its role as a globally competitive engine for the development and testing of new RNA-based therapies, with McGill training many students who will pursue careers in this vital sector.In the lobby of McGill’s Bellini Building, Prime Minister Trudeau and Premier Legault announce the construction of a new Moderna mRNA vaccine production plant in the  Montreal area. (Photo: Alex Tetreault PMO)Construction is set to start this year, with the Moderna facility expected to open, at earliest, by 2024. Once operational, the plant will produce up to 100 million vaccine doses annually, and will employ hundreds of Quebecers.Also present at Friday’s announcement were: Moderna’s chief executive officer, Stéphane Bancel, and general manager, Patricia Gauthier; federal ministers François-Philippe Champagne (Innovation, Science and Industry) and Jean-Yves Duclos (Health); and Quebec ministers Christian Dubé (Health and Social Services) and Pierre Fitzgibbon (Economy and Innovation).Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada relied on importing vaccines from other countries. Prime Minister Trudeau said Friday’s announcement fully aligns with the federal government’s commitment to strengthening Canada’s biomanufacturing and life sciences sector and vaccine-manufacturing capacity, ensuring a resilient future while at the same time growing the economy.“COVID-19 vaccines saved lives and got Canadians back to doing the things they love,” said the Prime Minister. “Today’s announcement means that Canadian workers and Canadian innovation will play a key role in keeping our communities safe now and in the future.“Being able to produce made-in-Canada mRNA vaccines is not just important for COVID-19 or for future pandemics. It also will have a significant impact on the research into a range of illnesses. We’re talking about Alzheimer’s, we’re talking about cancers, we’re talking about the range of things that messenger RNA is able to deliver to keep Canadians and people around the world healthy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks with McGill RNA research lab technicians. (Photo: Alex Tetreault PMO)“It also means hundreds of new, well-paying jobs as we recover from this pandemic and build a better future for everyone.”Revitalizing Canada’s bio-innovation sector requires a robust pipeline of highly trained scientists to support academic, industry, and government programs. Before the announcement, the Premier and the Prime Minister toured some of McGill’s genomic and RNA research laboratories that are already playing a critical role in creating cutting-edge discoveries—and in supplying Canada, and the world, with the much-needed next generation of leading RNA scientists.Moderna had been considering building its new $180-million facility—the company’s only operation outside the U.S.—in either the Toronto or Montreal areas. Premier Legault expressed his pride that Moderna has chosen Quebec.“Belle victoire!” he said. “This is good news for the Quebec economy, and good news for Quebec autonomy.” He called Moderna’s arrival in Montreal a “highly strategic” boost to an already strong sector. In addition to the research strengths of universities such as McGill, he noted that Quebec already has some 700 companies and 36,000 people working in the life sciences sector—an excellent foundation on which to achieve vaccine sovereignty.Although Moderna’s vaccine was the first mRNA dose to garner regulatory approval around the world, the company’s Stéphane Bancel reminded the audience that, at the outset of the pandemic, Moderna was a start-up with limited production capacity. The company needed to partner with other vaccine-producers to deliver millions of doses of its revolutionary vaccine. Canada alone distributed more than 29 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.Friday’s announcement included remarks from federal and Quebec politicians and Moderna executives.

We’re always impressed with the vision of the Canadian government, and its a sense of purpose for being ready for the next pandemic—which is what this factory is all about—and how much the government cares about the good health of the people of Canada.”Moderna’s Patricia Gauthier called the announcement “excellent news for everyone.” She praised the relationships that the new facility is strengthening, adding “And we can say with confidence that it’s only the beginning.”Indeed, McGill already has a long, fruitful history of collaboration with Moderna, which was founded by alumnus Noubar Afeyan. McGill professor Nahum Sonenberg, Canada’s leading expert on mRNA, was a consultant on the efficacy of Moderna’s modified mRNA to make proteins. And, just last month, McGill joined Moderna’s mRNA Access program, which aims to accelerate innovation and enable new vaccines and medicines for emerging and neglected infectious diseases through collaborative research and preclinical development.Watch a recording of Friday’s announcement:","Fri, 04/29/2022 - 13:21"
Newly certified sustainable offices at McGill: Spring 2022,"Celebrating a sustainable springtime can mean much more than just starting seedlings.For three McGill workplaces, a sustainable spring has meant recommitting to embedding sustainable practices into their daily lives, at home and at the office, with the Sustainable Workplace Certification Program. From developing a greater understanding of the social dimension of sustainability to learning how to further reduce waste, these teams have used the program to find sustainable habits that work for them.Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED) – BronzeNumber of team members: 4Sustainability Goal: To improve our office and home habits and environment, and find new team-building initiatives to promote sustainability at McGill.Sustainability is a core principle of the Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED).“The mission of TISED is to catalyze innovative engineering and design solutions to overcome local and global sustainability challenges,” explained Ambassador Parisa Hassani.While TISED provides McGill engineering students with interdisciplinary course options, research funding, and opportunities to engage through symposia, talks, and conferences, the team behind the Institute felt it was equally important to embody the values of sustainability through their day-to-day work.Through the bronze-level certification, the team has committed to actions such as prioritizing reusable dishware at home and the office, sharing details about proper waste disposal on campus, and making plans to step away from the computer to enjoy each other’s company at lunch hour.“Receiving this certification would provide the TISED team with recognition and encouragement to continue to play our role in making McGill University a more sustainable institution,” said Hassani.Desautels Faculty of Management Masters Office – SilverNumber of team members: 21Sample Silver-level Action: Work toward achieving gold-level certification in 2022“We completed the Bronze level certification at the end of 2021 and wanted to keep building on the momentum and seek our silver certification,” explained Ambassador Wesley McCoy.Through the silver-level certification, McCoy said his team has built greater “awareness of the small actions that can lead to a large impact on our sustainability.”“Our team has gained a deeper appreciation and awareness for making sustainable choices in their day-to-day life. Small actions have large impact,” he said.McCoy continued that through the certification, his team has developed an interest into the three dimensions of sustainability—environment, economics, and social—and how they relate to their faculty’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) initiatives.Maude Abbott Medical Museum (MAMM) – SilverNumber of team members: 10Sample silver-level action: Started a medicinal garden in the unused planters in front of Strathcona building. “We wanted to challenge ourselves and our colleagues to be more deliberate in our actions,” explained Sustainable Workplace Ambassador Callum Mullen.The research practices undertaken by members of the MAMM team produce waste inherently, said Mullen. By moving forward with the certification program, “we aimed to reduce the waste we produce as a team to try to take some of these practices back to our own classes, labs, and friend groups.”Through their participation in the Sustainable Workplace Certification program, Mullen said that these practices have become habit.“With the Bronze certification under our belt, we rarely have to think about the sustainability practices, it’s become second nature,” Mullen said. We’re happy to implement changes and encourage other teams to do the same.”The Sustainable Workplace Certification program includes environmentally, economically, and socially aware action items to inspire sustainable changes at work and at home.

Graduate students’ research communication skills take the stage at McGill’s 2022 3MT/MT180,"The 2022 McGill 3MT/MT180 finalists. (Photo by Vivienne Tam)The McGill-wide Three Minute Thesis (3MT) and Ma thèse en 180 secondes (MT180) competition are hosted annually by SKILLSETS in Teaching and Learning Services in collaboration with Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies. Since launching in 2008 at The University of Queensland, this global competition challenges graduate students to communicate their research to a general audience in three minutes or less and using only a single, static slide.The last time this event was hosted in-person was March 2020, at the doorstep of the disruption caused by the pandemic and the shift to remote teaching and learning at McGill. After running the 2021 competition fully online and spending a lot of time on Zoom in general, the 2022 main event returned to the Faculty Club ballroom on April 6th to an in-person audience, with over 100 people also joining live via YouTube. Reflecting on this year’s return to the Faculty Club, Associate Provost (Graduate Education) and Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, Josephine Nalbantoglu said, “Being back in person this year was a wonderful way to celebrate what is event is all about – our graduate students. They are the best of the best, and the incredible contributions to research of our entire graduate student community help shape excellence at McGill.”From the 15 exceptional graduate student finalists who delivered engaging presentations that truly communicated their passion for their research, the panel of judges had the challenging task of naming four prize winners. This year’s judging panel included Dr. Joe Schwarcz (Director, McGill Office for Science and Society), Justine Peres Smith (VP, Quebec Critic’s Association (AQCC)), Dr. Laura Winer (Director, Teaching and Learning Services) and Dr. Liette Lapointe (Vice-Dean of Programs, Information Systems and Associate Professor).The 2022 McGill 3MT/MT180 prize winners (left to right): Christian Moya Garcia, Muhammad Ghufran Rafique, Ylauna Penalva, Atia Amin, and Charlotte Maschke. (Photo by Vivienne Tam)First place in the 3MT was awarded to Atia Amin, a PhD student in Human Genetics, for their talk “Preventing Leishmaniasis Using Exosome​”. According to Atia, “participating in 3MT was a humbling experience for me. It was amazing to meet the presenters in-person during the finals and learn about their cutting-edge research projects”. Atia will now advance to represent McGill at the 2022 Canadian Association for Graduate Studies Eastern Regional 3MT competition. First place in the MT180 went to Ylauna Penalva, a PhD student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience, for their talk: La Maladie d’Alzheimer: Avant d’oublier. Ylauna now advances to represent McGill at the 2022 Finale national de Acfas MT180. Muhammad Ghufran Rafique (PhD, Chemistry) won second prize for “Integrating electronics with biology at the nanoscale”, and the third prize winner was Charlotte Maschke (PhD, Integrated Program in Neuroscience) for “Will he ever wake up again?”. Last but not least, the in-person and online audience also got to have their say. “Localized Laryngeal Cancer Treatment: Give Patients a Voice” by Christian Moya Garcia (PhD, Biological and Biomedical Engineering) was the 2022 people’s choice award winner.Another highlight was having graduate students themselves lead the show. This year, the final competition was co-hosted by two graduate students: Saima Ahmed (PhD, Experimental Medicine) and Nathalie Jreidini (PhD, Biology (Ecology & Evolution), and 2021 3MT Finalist). The commentaries between the two hosts created a uniquely fun experience for the audience that was engaging, dynamic, and humorous. As Nathalie remarked, “the tension is always high in any competition, but having two co-hosts who helped organize the 3MT and got to know the contestants helped ease the tension.” This sentiment was echoed by Saima: “Our job was easy; the finalists had prepared their talks so well and the audience was ready to absorb all that wonderful knowledge. The room had a great energy, we tried our best to keep it light and fun, sharing our genuine reactions and little anecdotes between talks.”With this showcase of communication skills and passion for research, there are many takeaways for participants, organizers, and audience members. According to Ylauna following her first-place award for the MT180, “I now always consider various ways to retain my audience’s attention while making sure they comprehend the key message of my talk. Another great experience was getting feedback from my fellow competitors. While you may expect that in a competition, people would be unwilling to give advice, the environment was actually very friendly and collaborative!” Despite the competitive nature of 3MT/MT180, this experience lends itself to creating a network of graduate students who are passionate about research communication and skills development that has the potential to grow further, beyond this annual competition.To learn about this year’s winners, finalists, and their exceptional research, you can watch the 2022 3MT/MT180 competition online and consult the competition program. For any eligible graduate students who may be interested in participating in the 2023 competition, registration will launch later this year.","Wed, 04/27/2022 - 15:34"
Minister Jean-Yves Duclos praises “lifesaving work” done by McGill engineering team,"The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos (left) and Civil Engineering Professor Dominic Frigon (right) tour wastewater testing facility at the McConnell Engineering BuildingOwen Egan / Joni Dufour The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, the federal Health Minister, visited the McConnell Engineering Building on Monday, April 25 to tour the wastewater surveillance program.Beginning in 2020 as a pilot project called CentrEAU-COVID, the effort to test wastewater for the SARS-COV-2 virus is led by McGill civil engineering professor Dominic Frigon, and is now funded by the Quebec Health and Social Services Ministry and the INSPQ (Institut national de santé publique du Québec). The project tests wastewater samples in Montreal, Laval, Quebec City and Gatineau to track the spread of the novel coronavirus as a cost-efficient complement to individual testing.Following a tour of the facility, Duclos praised the McGill team.“Your work is not only important now, but will continue in the short and longer term,” Duclos said. “COVID is not over, unfortunately. There’ll almost certainly be other forms of the pandemic to come.”In a tweet posted on Monday evening, Duclos thanked Frigon and his team “for the informative insight into wastewater surveillance and how data is interpreted to identify the spread of viruses and other diseases. This is lifesaving work.”The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos (center), with Vice-Principal (Research & Innovation) Martha Crago (left) and Prof. Frigon (right), praises the work being done at McGill to test wastewater for COVID-19Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Owen Egan / Joni Dufour","Tue, 04/26/2022 - 15:07"
International lab dedicated to artificial intelligence kicks off in Montreal,"Futuristic graphical user interface concept.A consortium of research organizations has gathered together to form a new International Laboratory on Learning Systems (ILLS) focused on artificial intelligence (AI) in Montreal. The new centre gathers together McGill University, École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), Mila – Quebec AI Institute, France’s Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Université Paris-Saclay, and the École CentraleSupélec. The move confirms Montreal’s status as a leader in AI.While great strides have been made in AI recently, there is still a pressing need for new theoretical knowledge to better understand not only the capacities of this new technology, but how it achieves its results. The ILLS will focus on five main themes of research: fundamental aspects of artificial intelligence, sequential (real-time) machine learning, robust autonomous systems, natural language and speech processing, and applications to computer vision, signals, and information processing.In addition, the new centre will emphasize interdisciplinary collaborations with an aim to develop new methodologies and integrate these techniques into learning systems.“This new laboratory confirms Montreal’s global leadership in AI,” said Benoit Boulet, Associate Vice-Principal, Research & Innovation at McGill University. “This is a major hub with a talent pool that continues to deepen, and McGill researchers and students are embedded at every level of this activity. This new initiative will offer opportunities for our researchers to make even more breakthrough discoveries.”“The expertise of ÉTS in AI includes several laboratories and research chairs in artificial intelligence. This collaboration between France and Quebec makes it possible to innovate and deepen research in AI, a cross-cutting discipline from which we can benefit in many fields, including health, the built environment, robotics, and the Internet of Things. It is therefore with pride that ÉTS welcomes the new ILLS centre within its establishment,” said Christian Casanova, Director of Research and Partnerships at ÉTS.“Through its tools of international cooperation, CNRS supports the most promising cutting-edge joint research projects. The new international research laboratory brings together a powerful network of researchers from France and Québec to advance the knowledge and applications of AI. For the CNRS, this new lab is also an opportunity to strengthen more broadly its ties with the whole Canadian AI community,” said Antoine Petit, Chairman and CEO of CNRS.“AI at Paris-Saclay involves nearly 1,000 researchers, teacher-researchers, engineers and technicians and around forty laboratories, grouped together within our DataIA Institute. We will make our contribution to the ILLS in the form of the mobility of researchers, including the reception of Canadian colleagues at Paris-Saclay, the reception of Masters trainees, thesis funding in particular/among others. The University of Paris-Saclay is honored and proud to be associated with this signing ceremony for the creation of the IRL ILLS and to ensure its joint supervision” added Michel Guidal, Deputy Vice-President Research Sciences and Engineering at Université Paris-Saclay.“The ILLS, resulting from an unprecedented and international union, offers a unique potential for progress in the field of AI. It is an honor for CentraleSupélec to participate with our prestigious partners in this laboratory. Backed by this research, our teaching will thus be at the forefront of the world in terms of AI,” added Romain Soubeyran, Director of CentraleSupélec.The ILLS will join a burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) sector in Montreal, which has attracted other major investments from government and business for the past several years. As a result, the city is one of the world’s leading hubs in this domain, with an estimated 27,000 workers in AI-related technologies and over 14,000 post-secondary students enrolled in AI-related study programs.The ILLS is the latest such laboratory to be launched in Canada, specifically in Quebec. In 2014, the CNRS and the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologie (FRQNT) signed a letter of intent to support and promote the tradition of scientific cooperation that exists between France and Quebec. This collaboration has resulted in two International Research Laboratories in Quebec, as well as other shared research activities across the province. The CNRS has also established three other IRLs in Canada in partnership with other institutions.Present at the signing ceremony were: Frédéric Sanchez (Consul General of France), Remi Quirion (Quebec’s Chief Scientist), Antoine Petit (CNRS), Suzanne Fortier (McGill University), Francois Gagnon (ETS), Michel Guidal (Université Paris-Saclay), Franck Richecoeur (École CentraleSupélec), and Laurence Beaulieu (Mila).","Tue, 04/26/2022 - 11:02"

Canadian Immigrant Magazine honours McGill med student,"Second-year McGill medical student, Saman Arfaie, has been selected as a finalist for the Top 25 Immigrants in Canada. An annual campaign by Canadian Immigrant Magazine, this national award recognizes outstanding work by immigrants who “have come to Canada and have made a positive difference living in the country.” Amongst the top 75 Candidates, 25 will be honoured with this award through daily cumulative votes. You can cast your vote online.The Reporter spoke with Arfaie about, among other things, his family’s path from Iran to Canada, his motivation to become a doctor and his love and gratitude for his adopted country.Where were you born and raised? Can you describe your home country?I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran. There is so much to talk about! Iran is a country with a very rich history and many cultural traditions. Iranians love guests and appreciate visitors quite a lot. I always found myself fascinated by Persian history, poetry, pottery, and calligraphy. I am proud of my background because it provides me with a deep root of grounding. Growing up, I was constantly reminded of the value of hard work and creating opportunities for others.How did your parents influence you? My parents are both physicians. My mother is a diagnostic radiologist, and my father is an orthopedic surgeon. When we first immigrated to Canada, they sacrificed their entire careers and clinical practice, so that I could have the opportunity to grow up in Canada. I always believed that love is about sacrifice and I saw it firsthand.What I admire most about them is that they never told me what I ought to do with my life or what career trajectory I should pursue. Instead, I was granted the liberty to think for myself and develop that autonomy of thought from a young age. In my opinion, it is crucial for one’s development to make decisions for oneself and keep that sense of accountability preserved.I did observe, every day, that despite the long hours in the operating room or at the hospital, they were always fulfilled. The internal gratification from their work surely did not go unnoticed.What were your first memories of Canada? Tiny drops of rain falling with a harmonizing sense and a constant rhythm on the thirsty ground! That, I find, is my first recollection of Vancouver, British Columbia, where we officially immigrated in July 2009. The memories of that night are crystal clear to me: wandering around in the streets with several heavy luggage, and optimistic with the vision to build a better future.I also have many fond memories of piano lessons at the UBC School of Music. Long hours in the practice room remind me of the importance of discipline and a yearning desire to search for the truth. Classical music has been the backbone of my life and a great stabilizing force. I credit this maturity of passion to Canada, too.In your biography on the Canadian Immigrant website, you write that you ‘hope to serve the country that opened its doors and took [you] in’. How do you describe Canada and being a Canadian? Like love and great works of art, loyalty and trust are central foundations for any relationship. This extends beyond people and holds the same charm when it comes to places that are near and dear to us. I felt this relationship and close affinity with Canada. Canada is a great nation that celebrates inclusion and diversity. Canadians are friendly, polite, and enlightened people, and this fact holds true from province to province.I have been fortunate to attend a public education system in the Vancouver School Board and credit my formative teachers for providing me with the support to trust in my intuition.  Without question, I have also been a beneficiary of all the opportunities made available to me during my academic trajectory. I recognize that I was granted an equal opportunity to learn, grow, and mature. I hope to be able to contribute in a meaningful way during my career and later years to fulfill this sense of loyalty and trust.What is your educational background? I have a B.Sc. in Molecular Cell Biology (Neurobiology emphasis) an Honours B.A. in Persian Literature and double minors in Chemistry and Music from the University of California, Berkeley.Why did you choose McGill?McGill was a natural choice due to its rich history, intellectual lineage, and culture of innovation. We all like to connect with the past, and McGill enjoys a pantheon of great minds that bridge this transition. It also happens to be the oldest medical school in Canada. Research done by McGill was frequently cited and always respected, back in my studies at UC Berkeley, so I wanted to have a formative part of my educational experience take shape here in Montreal.I am also in love with neuroscience, so it is difficult to miss the contributions made at McGill in this arena. Many names stand out and amongst them are the revolutionary work of pioneering neurosurgeon-scientist Wilder Penfield (who founded the Montreal Neurologic Institute), David Hubel, and Torsten Wiesel (1981 Physiology/Medicine Nobel), and John O’Keefe (2014 Physiology/Medicine Nobel).You are one of the youngest finalists in a distinguished national cohort of nominees. How did you feel about this when you first learned the news, and why have you chosen to pursue a career as an aspiring physician-scientist? Shock and humility! It is an absolute honour to be amongst this group and learn from all the groundbreaking work they do.Ever since my interests in medicine and scientific research were sparked early on, I have felt both deeply-rooted passions develop together. It is beautiful how interconnected they are at their core. Having a scientific mindset for discovery further motivates me to look harder for practical solutions to improve patient care. Few ideas can be as rewarding for me as applying my love for research to alleviate human suffering. The reverse is equally true – I know I will be a better scientist by understanding first-hand what my patients need to heal and thrive.What impact have you made at the national level so far during your studies? Back in 2020, I co-founded the Canadian Medical Student Interest Group in Neurosurgery (CaMSIGN) with two of my colleagues, Mohammad Mashayekhi and Pedram Laghaei, who are currently studying at the UBC Faculty of Medicine. Our student-led group is the first national platform dedicated to the pillars of neurosurgical education, research, advocacy, and mentorship. With over 20+ events, a blog focused on education and CaRMS interviews, encouragement of more representation of women to pursue surgical specialties, and other neurosurgery-focused content, CaMSIGN’s role is to connect all students interested in the field with residents and faculty across the country.What are some other projects you are currently working on? COVID-19 has become a topic of fascination and scholarly interest. I am currently co-authoring a book on the subject. This is being done alongside two of my dear friends and colleagues at Queen’s University, Peter J. Glinos (PhD candidate) and Faraz Honarvar (medical student). This is the first multi-dimensional collection of interviews and analyses with Canada’s leading experts that distills insights from molecular biologists, infectious disease researchers, population health experts, healthcare professionals, policy and legal experts, historians, and psychologists. The aim of our book is to produce a comprehensive and holistic history of the pandemic in Canada.I am also in the process of writing another book with my friend and colleague, Professor Philip Pearl of Harvard Medical School titled ‘The Neurobiology of Creativity: Music, Medicine, and the Art of Self-Expression.’What were some of the thoughts that entered your mind during the white coat ceremony? I love this question. It is one that has occupied my mind and I even wrote about it on LinkedIn. Four points continue to resonate:The first step in becoming responsible for another being is only possible via actively seeking responsibility.During moments of suffering and pain, we feel most human. In a career that will directly weave through and traverse some of the most difficult times for patients and their loved ones, it is essential to have a comprehensive grasp of the human condition and cultivate the emotional means to serve others with grace and compassion. We must also care for ourselves.Gratitude for being a medical practitioner can be manifested in the following two ways amongst others: i) Through a deep recognition of the complexity of human anatomy, physiology, and its molecular systems. This will be crucial to best understand disease etiologies, guiding our diagnosis and treatment. ii) The acceptance that human health, while our default setting, is not assured.We must transition from being consumers of knowledge to producers of it. Innovating the current medical landscape, especially in cases when treatment modalities fail or no cures exist, will be central via dedicated devotion to basic and translational research.You recently gave a TEDx talk and piano performance at McGill University. Tell us more about it. I am interested in the unification of knowledge through the overlap of sciences with humanities. ‘Illuminating the Human Journey: Music, Medicine and Meaning’ was a celebration of how that connection is made relevant to medicine. [Watch Arfaie’s TEDx talk]Any final thoughts you would like to share with us? To me, virtues matter more than accomplishments. To be a good human being is to have a sense of openness to the world. An ability to stay connected and grounded is a far more important quality than how many awards you win, peer-reviewed papers you publish, or other recognitions you receive. Those are the cherry on top of the cake, but without the former (virtues), there would be a void within that nothing would ever replace or complement. This is what the first principles do.I say it again and again about how lucky and blessed I have been to be where I stand: to be surrounded by brilliant medical school colleagues (whom I learn from daily), inspiring scientists, and thoughtful mentors here at McGill University. We are the total summation of the people we have met, the mentors we have had, and the thoughts we have pursued. In that sense, there is no sense of ego. And there can never be!We must be grateful for the efforts and support of people who have helped in shaping our life trajectory: both those who are with us and continue their support, and those who used to be but no longer are. Complete independence is an illusion that hinders our growth, for growth is only attained through the meaningful bonds we form with one another and the world around us.","Fri, 04/22/2022 - 11:08"
On top of the world,"Montreal’s Les Suprêmes won the ISU World Synchronized Skating Championships on April 9, in Hamilton, Ont.Danielle Earl April is a busy, often stressful, time of year for students. Final exams and end-of-year assignments loom large, demanding optimal performance for those who want top marks.Some people say it is a dry run for life outside the Roddick Gates. McGill undergrads Olivia Ronca and Loriana Cocca might agree. On April 9, as part of Montreal’s Les Suprêmes synchronized skating team, they gave a performance of a lifetime, earned top marks and were crowned world champions.Sitting in second place after the short program, the 20-skater team vaulted to the top of the podium with a stellar free skate. The gold marked Canada’s first victory in seven years at the ISU World Synchronized Skating Championships. To top it off, the team’s final score broke the world record.“Although we were ecstatic about our score [after the free skate], there was one more team left to skate after us, so we weren’t sure what the final result,” said Ronca, in her first year of a Bachelor of Arts degree. “When we were told the news later in the dressing room, we couldn’t believe it, and most of us started jumping up and down and crying. I, for one, thought I was dreaming.”Home ice advantageThe event was held in Hamilton, Ontario, giving the two Canadian teams in the competition a distinct home ice advantage.Olivia Ronca (left) and Loriana Cocca moments after their gold-medal performance “The last time the World Championships were held in Canada was in 2015, and many of us on the team were in the stands watching, hoping to some day be on that ice,” said Cocca, a U2 Nutrition and Dietetics student. “It was a dream come true, and to have bring home the world title was surreal.”“Our team definitely fed off of the energy of the crowd during our performances, and it was surreal to be able to look up and see a sea of red and white flags while we were skating,” said Ronca. “Not to mention, many of us were so happy to be able to compete in front of our friends and family, who were also happy to come and watch live skating after such a long time due to the pandemic.”Winning on home soil – or ice – made the podium ceremony all the more poignant.“This is a moment that will be engraved in my memory and heart for the rest of my life,” said Cocca. “Being on that podium, it felt like time was slowed down. Singing the anthem, seeing our flag being raised, and standing on that podium with my best friends brought me to tears. It is an indescribable feeling and such an honour.”“Being able to stand on the podium singing O Canada at home was surreal. I think that’s really when what had happened started to sink in for me, and that I realized I’d accomplished the dream I had had for 11 years,” said Ronca.Road to podium paved with hard workOf course, like all great sports stories, this one is not without its blood, sweat and tears.During a regular season, Les Suprêmes practice five days a week, for a total of about 20 hours a week. This includes on-ice training, as well as ballet, fitness and strength training, yoga, and running through their routines off-ice to make sure everything is clean and precise.The pandemic threw a monkey wrench into the proceedings. Lockdowns meant the team had to suspend much of its on-ice training. “We continued doing off-ice training at a distance, while being unsure about the future of our season, or if we’d ever be able to get back on the ice in time for our Nationals (the World Championship qualifiers),” said Cocca.“Additionally, in the month leading up to the world championships, we had seven different COVID cases on our team, which meant quite a few of us were isolating at home during what should be the most practice-heavy time of the season,” continued Cocca.“Those who were isolated continued training as best as possible over FaceTime or Zoom, while the rest of the team continued going to practice in person. While it was difficult to maintain our regular training with these conditions, our team kept a positive and perseverant attitude all the way up to the competition, which helped us to be ready in the end.”Balancing school and sportAs if the demands of a world-class athlete weren’t enough, Cocca and Ronca must also focus on their studies.“It is definitely challenging to be a student-athlete, especially at the university level. Especially at McGill, which we know is very demanding,” says Ronca. “However, having been a student-athlete for such a long time, I’ve learned how to juggle both my academic and athletic life over the years – which I’m sure many other student-athletes can relate to. What’s most important is finding a balance between school and sports and organizing yourself early on in the season, so that you don’t wear yourself thin later on in the year.”World championship behind them, McGill’s dynamic duo look forward to continue skating – and developing their friendship.“Olivia and I met in 2017 when I first joined the Les Suprêmes family,” said Cocca. “We are so similar and bonded right away. Olivia and I will now be starting our fifth skating season together, and I am so excited to live new experiences and memories with her.”Les Suprêmes give their gold-medal performance.

Student appetite growing for World of Chemistry: Food course,"(From left to right): Joe Schwarcz, David Harpp, and Ariel Fenster, the creators of the popular World of Chemistry courseIn 1982, McGill chemistry professors David Harpp, Joe Schwarcz, Ariel Fenster designed and launched the World of Chemistry: Food and Drugs course. Little did they know at the time that the course would become McGill’s and Canada’s most popular elective course – and one that has evolved radically from its traditional lecture-hall beginnings.Eventually expanding to four separate courses (Food, Drugs, Technology and the Environment), World of Chemistry-Food was also the first McGill MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), going online in 2014 – seven years before the COVID pandemic turned the world into a giant case study for virtual learning.“All added up, we have had over 51,000 students since 1982 in these courses but over 11,500 have been in the past four years in the Food course alone,” says Harpp, Tomlinson Chair of Science Education. “The peak enrolment for Drugs was 1,500 last fall and the peak enrolment for Food is over 2,300 students this semester.”The student response has been overwhelmingly positive with many commenting that it is the most useful course they have taken at McGill.If the summer Food course follows past enrollment benchmarks, Harpp says some 3,000 students will have taken the Food course in 2022.Self-paced learningWhile virtual, the World of Chemistry Food course is substantially different than your standard Zoom lecture.To begin with, each section has been pre-recorded by Harpp, Schwarcz and Fenster in a studio and, with the help of Teaching and Learning Services, include a series of graphics and short videos designed to transmit information in what Harpp calls a “digestible” fashion. “We’re wearing ties and look quite presentable,” says Harpp with a laugh. “It’s as polished as it can be.”The Food course is 39 hours, which includes over 100 videos running between five and 15 minutes. “I think one of the appealing features is that students aren’t just sitting there taking in a lecture,” says Harpp. “They can stop, take a break, and come back to the video when they are ready.”Students have access to the transcript of each video; playback speed options; and a series of activities and short quizzes to help them prepare for exams. They are also able to work with and have discussions with other students and course mentors.5,000 mentors and counting Harpp says the mentors, part of the TEAM program (Tomlinson Engagement Award for Mentoring) he started in 2013, is one of the keys to the World of Chemistry’s success.“The TEAM mentors coordinate the discussion board, make up the practice quizzes and do one-on-one consultations with the students,” says Harpp, noting that the mentors are funded as part of the landmark $65-million gift made to the University by Richard Tomlinson in 2000.“They are highly motivated and, as some of the [Food course’s] top students from previous years, they know the material very well,” says Harpp. “And, for the mentors, they are getting valuable experience that will, no doubt, benefit them later in life.”To date, slightly over 5,000 participants have served as mentors across the University, including 1,000 this year, dealing with some nearly 200 courses.This semester, Mount Allison University in Sackville, NB has signed on to this course for the second time this semester.","Thu, 04/21/2022 - 10:28"
Law student honoured by Royal Society of Canada,"The Royal Society of Canada (RSC) has awarded the inaugural Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella Prize to a graduating student in 23 law schools in Canada. Niamh Leonard, who will graduate from the BCL/JD program at McGill this spring, was named one of the winners.“We are very proud of the inaugural winners of the Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella Prize, who represent the values of equality and equity we need in our country as we move forward,” said RSC President Dr. Jeremy N. McNeil in the press release.Niamh Leonard will graduate from the Faculty of Law’s BCL/JD program this spring. “Niamh Leonard has a decade of experience working on social impact initiatives, from equipping young people to become active citizens at Apathy is Boring, to supporting refugee claimants at Welcome Collective, to researching how surveillance impacts human rights at Citizen Lab,” said the RSC citation.Prior to law school, Leonard was a program officer at the McConnell Foundation, a philanthropic foundation that applies social innovation and social finance approaches to some of Canada’s greatest challenges: the equitable transition to a low-carbon economy; reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples; and the development of inclusive, resilient communities.Leonard is a board member of The Schumacher Center for a New Economics and of Welcome Collective.The RSC established the Prize in honour of Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella, a changemaker celebrated for her visionary intellectual contributions and commitment to building equality and equity across Canadian society and beyond.The Prize in the amount of $1,000 is presented annually to a graduating law student in every law school in Canada.The initiative to establish the Prize was led by the Right Hon.

Isabelle Prévost-Aubin: Championing Indigenous representation at McGill,"Fifth-year engineering student Isabelle Prévost-Aubin helped spearhead the Projections: Kwe initiative.Jonas HendersonLike many students this deep into the semester, Isabelle Prévost-Aubin is eyeing the finish line with great anticipation. That anticipation is heightened, as the fifth-year mechanical engineering undergrad will be collecting her degree in less than two months.But Prévost-Aubin will also be leaving something behind when she leaves McGill, something of great significance for the University. A Métis from Sudbury, Ontario, in Robinson-Huron Treaty territory, Prévost-Aubin is one of the McGill students who spearheaded and curated the Projections: Kwe digital exhibition of Indigenous art that is being showcased in the lobby of the McConnell Engineering Building. The goal of the exhibit is to increase visibility, representation, and inclusion of Indigenous students and cultures in the Faculty of Engineering“Isabelle has not only done incredible work in establishing and developing Projections; Kwe, but also in supporting Indigenous communities at McGill,” said Jim Nicell, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, during the launch event on April 13. “In her time at McGill she has been involved in the McGill chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, has held multiple executive positions in SSMU’s Indigenous Students Alliance, and formed the Indigenous Inclusion Committee (IIC) under the Engineering Undergraduate Society, in addition to advocating for indigenous sovereignty and environmental rights. In future years she wishes to incorporate Indigenous sovereignty and power in the work she does in renewable energies and sustainability. The Faculty is proud and humbled to be home to students like Isabelle whose work continues to challenge and transform the professions.”The Reporter spoke with Prévost-Aubin about the Projections: Kwe project.Could you tell us about the genesis of the Indigenous Inclusion Committee?A few years ago, when participating in events from AISES’s (the American Indian Science and Engineering Society) chapter at McGill, I noticed that many other universities had programs to either increase the visibility or generally help Indigenous students in STEM in their academic and personal careers.I started asking my Indigenous peers, in engineering and in other programs as well, how they thought the Faculty of Engineering could improve its relationship with Indigenous students and staff, and how they could support us better.From these discussions and ideas, I went to the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS). EUS recommended that I form a committee under them in order to have access to more resources and contacts. Hence, the Indigenous Inclusion Committee was formed, right as COVID initially hit. We were, of course, affected by this, but the ideas from my peers drove me to continue with a few goals, namely, installing Indigenous artwork, and including the INDG courses as acceptable Complimentary Studies B in the curriculum. Tell us about the beginnings of the Projections: Kwe initiative. Kwe was originally supposed to only be physical paintings, such as the Benjamin Chee Chee artworks that you can now see in the McConnell building. However, two events occurred simultaneously.First, a friend of mine, a former Creative Director in the EUS, reached out about the projector project, and provided me with the past research that the Creative Directors have been doing for this project. At the same time, the Faculty of Engineering and the Indigenous Studies and Community Engagement Initiative reached out about making this into a projector, to continue this project that was already started. Therefore, as a way to commemorate the Bicentennial of McGill, and to promote even more the visibility of minorities in the Faculty of Engineering, Kwe was started.Who are the IIC members spearheading this project?I put together a team of Indigenous students, both in Engineering and in other programs, to have their opinions. It was critical that a team of us could discuss the art and bounce ideas off of one another – the aspect of community work is critical in such projects.Also, prioritizing Indigenous voices was key. These were Indigenous artwork, and this project, all things considered, is for current and future Indigenous students. Having First Nations, Inuit, and Métis voices was not up for discussion. This is how Dallas Karonhia’no:ron Canady-Binette (Kanesatake’ro:non, Kanien’keha:ka), Jonas Henderson (Kalaaleq), Kayleigh Spencer (James Bay Cree), and Jocelyne Couture (Métis Nation of Ontario) joined the team. I could not have finished this project without their contributions and kind words.Specifically, Dallas helped in so many ways, in attending meetings, providing opinions and feedback, even in writing the curatorial statement that is next to the projector! I could not have asked for a better team. I am forever grateful for their support and kind words.How did you select the art? It must have been extremely difficult to narrow it down to the final pieces. Absolutely! When we got together, we had a few goals and priorities in mind:We wanted to have as much diversity in the Nations of the artists/type of art as possible. The goal was to completely demolish the stereotype that all Indigenous art is the same. Different materials, different regions of the world were highlighted, and diversity in the pieces were celebrated. The transparency of the history of the pieces, and proper credit to the artist. Unfortunately, we did notice during our review of the artwork that many pieces did not have a listed artist, and for us, it was simply unacceptable to promote this art without the ability to credit the artist. In addition, not having the artist, their nation, or the name of the piece, also suggested that the history of the piece was unknown, or blurry. Given the violent history that Indigenous peoples have with colonial institutions, we wanted to ensure that the pieces shown in this space were pieces that were voluntarily given/obtained respectfully by the University or the previous owner of the artwork.Ease of digitization. Some pieces were in very difficult areas and were not easily accessible to digitize, in order to obtain them in a proper format for the projector. This also played a role in the selection.Even with these priorities, we still provided a list of over a hundred pieces to the Visual Arts Collection (VAC), after over four hours of selection and discussion. The final narrowing of the selection was thus from the VAC team – we were simply not able to choose!Do you have a favourite piece, or favourite pieces – ones that may connect with you more than others? I do connect quite a bit with the Benjamin Chee Chee paintings. He is from the same region as me and is quite popular back home. Also, funnily enough, his Afternoon Flight painting reminds me of my Fluid Mechanics 1 course, where we were taught about streamlining and drag reduction – some of the most optimal methods are used by geese in their flight patterns and shape.The paintings by Leo Yerxa also reach me quite a bit, but for these, I can’t explain them in words. Sometimes, it’s just a matter of connection.Finally, Roy Thomas’ New Year is also one of my favourites. It is just so bright and beautiful, and every time I look at it, I find a new connection – from the inner animals, to the faces painted in the four colors of the medicine wheel, to the connecting strands of Grandfather Sun. It is simply a stunning piece.Why is it important to have this type of exhibition of Indigenous art on display in Engineering and, in a larger sense, at McGill?Oh boy, I could write a full essay about this, and many Indigenous students actually have!In terms of McGill, I would simply suggest reading on the impacts of Indigenous peoples in colonial institutions.Some of members of the Indigenous Inclusion Committee (l to r): Dallas Karonhia’no:ron Canady-Binette, Kayleigh Spencer, Isabelle Prévost-Aubin and Jonas HendersonJonas HendersonSpecific to engineering, however, I find that it can be easy to forget the reason why we design, fabricate, and innovate, as well as the impacts that engineers have, every day. The reality is that Indigenous communities on Turtle Island are often disproportionately affected by our decisions, specifically with regard to environmental impacts. The pipelines that are constructed against the will and power of Indigenous peoples, the pulp and paper mills that emit by-products in the rivers and the air, the location and content of landfill sites, and their emissions. Engineers have a say in these decisions, and have a “seat at the table”.As the next generation of engineers, we need to be educated and should be educating others, on the impacts of our decisions. This needs to include BIPOC and Asian people. It needs to include disabled people, it needs to include queer and trans folks, it needs to include minorities.Not only does it affect these folks, but they should also be part of the solution. How are engineers supposed to create the ideal solution if they aren’t knowledgeable about the problem itself? We are on Native Land. As future engineers, we should have knowledge about where we’re working, and how our projects impact the communities that are caretakers of this land, and have been for centuries.First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people can also bring unique perspectives and experiences. These should be celebrated, and in the least, Indigenous peoples should feel welcomed in engineering spaces. The expression Kwe is one recognized in many dialects and languages, a way to greet someone warmly, to welcome them. This was how the name was chosen, and the impact I hope the projector exhibition has on Indigenous students and staff at McGill.What are your plans after graduation?For a few years, I plan to work in renewable energies in Tio’tia:ke. I enjoyed working in geothermal heating in the past, and think that renewable energies have a large role to play in the fight against climate change. Later on, I do want to return to school to obtain a Master’s degree and am thinking of pursuing ecological anthropology. It’s a field that encompasses my passion for the caretaking of the land, but could allow for my technical background in engineering to take part in the research at hand.The Projections: Kwe digital exhibition of Indigenous art is being showcased in the lobby of the McConnell Engineering Building.

Sustainable Sparks: Charlotte Aubrac on uniting the student body in a time of transition,"Charlotte Aubrac, Post-Graduate Student Society’s Environment CommissionerSiddhi AubeeluckWhen Charlotte Aubrac began her role as the Post-Graduate Student Society’s (PGSSS) Environment Commissioner in 2020, McGill – and the world – had transitioned to connecting entirely online. Despite the barriers to creating sustainable change, Charlotte has continued to push for transformation at McGill through outreach, carbon offsetting projects, gardening initiatives, and Fair Trade Campus certification. In a sit-down with the Office of Sustainability, Charlotte reflects on how the pandemic has shaped the way she views creating community. Tell me a bit about yourself and your interest in sustainability. I was always interested in environmental protection, so when I joined McGill for my undergrad in 2015, I got really involved in student activism around sustainability through different projects.Because I began in [the sciences], I started learning about sustainability from the perspective of environmental protection, but as I learned more about it, I came to really admire how interdisciplinary sustainability is; it’s not just about the environment, it’s an umbrella term that includes social justice, equity, and diversity.  You can’t just save the bees and accept Indigenous communities without clean drinking water; you need these two things to have a good world.Sustainability encompasses so many values that resonate with me.You are involved in many initiatives on campus, what have been some of your favorite memories so far?I think [getting involved on campus is] a great way to just find like-minded people who may have different ways of thinking about the world or have different ideas for solutions. My favorite role on campus so far has been being a part of the PGSS Environment Committee. I get to work with amazing people, which I love. People come to sustainability from all different backgrounds and it’s inspiring to see all of us converge to work on the same issues. Plus, we get to organize awesome events! For example, last summer we organized a cleanup tour on Mount Royal which was led by Redpath Outreach Coordinator Ingrid Birker, who was such an amazing tour guide.Another way I have enjoyed getting involved is being on the Fair Trade Campus committee. This year we came together for Fair Trade Campus Week, which happened last semester. We organized a PGSS bake sale. This was happening during a bit of gray area in the pandemic regulations-wise, so we would have loved to do more, but couldn’t. Hopefully next year we will organize more informative events to raise awareness about Fair Trade on campus.You began not only your graduate studies, but also your position as PGSS Environment Commissioner during the peak of the pandemic. How has having to adjust to working on sustainability online shaped your perspective of how communities can be created and take action?I’m going to be honest; it was challenging. I think one lesson that I learned from that is that even though there was a need to feel like people belonged to a community, the online context was not conducive to creating a community. I personally didn’t have a lot of success with workshops or live outreach to people because everyone was so burnt out, so I used social media a lot instead. This way I was allowing people to come and engage when they had the capacity to, which is a lot better than trying to force people on zoom for hours.Despite the challenges, I think there are also many benefits to remote or blended sustainable work. Being on Zoom is definitely way more accessible in so many aspects. During the pandemic, a lot of people weren’t in Canada at all, but you could still work together and talk. It’s definitely made work and meeting with people a lot more accessible.How has your experience in your role as PGSS commissioner and your involvement with the McGill Office of Sustainability (MOOS) shaped your idea of sustainability on campus?I’d like to say that I’m helping cultivate a more sustainable graduate community at McGill, and I do that through organizing events with the Environment Committee, social media, and keeping up with all the sustainability work that’s going on campus.Through this role, I get to interact with different members of McGill as well. One of the good parts about working in the pandemic was seeing how hard everyone else was pushing to address issues despite the circumstances. In my undergrad, I was more involved on the student side and I saw so much effort coming from the student body to make campus a more sustainable place. Now that I have worked as a Commissioner and been involved with MOOS, I admire how much effort is coming from staff and faculty as well.There are so many people that are so motivated to make this campus more sustainable and who have ideas for different projects. There are a lot of people on this campus that want to make change happen, and it’s so inspiring to see and be a part of.If you had one lesson to share with the McGill community about overcoming barriers to take sustainable action, what would it be?You have to be patient and you have to stay motivated. Get involved and say yes to projects that interest you, and don’t be afraid to ask questions or admit that you are wrong.Being surrounded with people that have the same values as you is such a great way to get perspective. I feel like sustainability now feels very daunting and there’s this huge pressure to be perfect, but I don’t believe you have to be. Even just considering the impact of your actions or taking extra time to change one part of your life makes you a part of [the sustainability movement]. Just take one step at a time.Like I said before, the different perspectives in sustainability work means that we all have something different to bring to the table, even though we share the same values.  There’s no guideline for the “right” way to do things, and there are so many ways that you can make a difference, you just have to find which way is meant for you.","Wed, 04/20/2022 - 16:18"
McGill named one of Canada’s Greenest Employers for fifth consecutive year,"In honour of McGill’s Bicentennial, students, staff and faculty planted 200 trees at Macdonald Campus between October 2020 and October 2021Ben JoppkeMcGill has been named one of Canada’s Greenest Employers for the fifth consecutive year, Mediacorp Canada announced earlier today.The designation “recognizes the employers that lead the nation in creating a culture of environmental awareness in their organizations,” explains Mediacorp Canada, an editorial group that hosts a series of competitions that recognize organizations that support employee success and engagement across different areas.“More than ever, employees and job seekers are showing a preference for workplaces that align with their values. This designation reflects the importance of sustainability efforts that many McGill employees support and contribute to in tangible ways,” said Diana Dutton, Associate Vice-Principal Human Resources.Staff spark change with the Sustainability Projects FundLike in past years, the Greenest Employer designation recognizes the staff-driven culture of sustainability at McGill. Tools such as McGill’s flagship Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) allow community members to become agents of change in their own areas of work or study by providing the funding and support needed to kickstart sustainability initiatives. The SPF is the largest fund of its kind in Canada, valued at $1 million annually.“The Sustainability Projects Fund is a cornerstone of sustainability at McGill,” said Executive Director of Sustainability Francois Miller. “We are proud to offer our staff, students and faculty the tools and support to become agents of change, further embedding sustainability into the DNA of our University.”Such staff-led initiatives include the Solin Hall Green Roof project, led by Maintenance Manager Jonathan Rousham. When it became clear that the roof on the annex of the Solin Hall residence needed to be replaced, Rousham applied to the SPF to conduct a feasibility study that would determine whether a green roof would be possible.On the Macdonald Campus, a cohort of staff, students, and faculty members chose to honour the University’s bicentennial celebrations by planting 200 trees in underutilized areas, also with support from the SPF. The tree planting, which took place from October 2020 to October 2021, allowed members of the McGill community to engage in the greening of the campus while improving the pedestrian experience and creating learning and teaching opportunities for Farm Management Technology and Plant Science courses.All in for zero-wasteMcGill’s significant commitment to becoming zero-waste by 2035 is also recognized by the Greenest Employer designation.Since 2020, McGill has installed more than 400 standardized waste sorting stations as a part of the University’s Waste Reduction and Diversion Strategy 2018-2025. With additional support from RECYC-QUÉBEC, the province’s recycling agency, and the SPF, the University has also expanded compost collection in more than 20 major academic buildings across both the downtown and Macdonald Campus.“We’re thrilled to be contributing to McGill’s sustainability strategy and by the recognition the community’s efforts are receiving,” said George Lazaris, Director, Buildings and Grounds. “We’re already seeing the benefits of the waste sorting stations and look forward to the even greater strides we can make toward our zero-waste goal through the expanded organic waste collection.”These efforts are complemented by a waste education program out of the Office of Sustainability. Two interns, hired in Winter 2022, oversee an inaugural cohort of Zero-Waste Ambassadors and will conduct waste audits to promote proper waste sorting habits across campus.Want to learn more about how you can get involved in sustainability at McGill?

PhD student honoured by Ecological Society of America,"On April 19, the Ecological Society of America (ESA) announced the winners of its annual awards, which recognize outstanding contributions to ecology in new discoveries, teaching, sustainability, diversity and lifelong commitment to the profession.Caroline S. Dallstream, a PhD student in the Department of Biology was named winner of the E. Lucy Braun Award for Excellence in Ecology.Caroline S. Dallstream’s work with leaf nutrient resorption conjured many questions about the roles of roots in plant nutrient economies. Joelle PetittiLucy Braun, an eminent plant ecologist and one of the charter members of the ESA, studied and mapped the deciduous forest regions of eastern North America and described them in her classic book, The Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America. To honour her, the E. Lucy Braun Award for Excellence in Ecology is given to a student for the outstanding poster presentation at the ESA Annual Meeting.Papers and posters are judged on the significance of ideas, creativity, quality of methodology, validity of conclusions drawn from results, and clarity of presentation. Dallstream’s work with leaf nutrient resorption conjured many questions about the roles of roots in plant nutrient economies.Dallstream’s poster, entitled Drought promotes early leaf abscission regardless of leaf habit but increases litter phosphorus losses only in evergreens, demonstrated drought impacts on ecosystem nutrient cycling through changes in litter chemistry.“Dallstream’s findings show that drought can cause premature leaf shedding in southern temperate forests, but that it affects deciduous and evergreen nutrient cycling differently,” said the ESA citation. “Her study suggests that more frequent and intense droughts could further alter nutrient cycling, leading to increased litter phosphorus losses for evergreens and potential shifts in species composition in southern temperate forests.”ESA will present the 2022 awards during a ceremony at the Society’s upcoming Annual Meeting, which will take place in Montreal, from Sunday, August 14, through Friday, August 19.Read the ESA press release","Tue, 04/19/2022 - 23:52"
McGill professors launch interactive sustainability dashboard for Montreal,"(Left to right): David Wachsmuth, Kevin Manaugh, and Andrew Gonzalez are the research leads of Sus – a new, interactive and fully bilingual sustainability dashboard for Montreal What if you could gather together as much sustainability-related information as possible about a city, and use it to create new knowledge for a wide and diverse audience? That is essentially what three McGill professors have assembled with Sus – a new, interactive and fully bilingual sustainability dashboard for the Montreal urban area, launching on April 25 (in French) and April 26 (in English). Funded by McGill’s Sustainability Systems Initiative (MSSI), which advances interdisciplinary research projects at McGill, Sus’s name is a playful reference to “sustainability,” though its value to the city can be of great consequence.“The idea behind Sus is to provide a tool for people to explore sustainability issues in Montreal,” explains David Wachsmuth, Associate Professor in the McGill School of Urban Planning and Canada Research Chair in Urban Governance, and one the three lead researchers on Sus.“There are lots of examples of web dashboards which put layers on a map, but what we’ve tried to do is explore connections, and how different aspects of sustainability issues connect to each other,” says Wachsmuth. “Sus will show you, for example, a map about the potential for active living across the Montreal region. But it will also show you how that intersects with household income, or concentrations of new immigrants, or people who drive versus bike to work, for example, exploring the intersections between different sustainability issues in an interactive, dynamic way.”Commitment to environmental and distributional justiceThe platform will be of interest to a wide range of users interested in sustainability, including scholars and academics, policy makers and community leaders, journalists and the general public. “We’ve always envisioned it as something that would be useful for an average citizen – a resident of the city who wants to know more about their neighborhood and has some interest in sustainability questions, such as green space provision,” says Kevin Manaugh, Associate Professor in the McGill Department of Geography and Bieler School of Environment. “Ultimately, we want it to be a tool that decision makers can use.”What drives Sus is not just knowledge for its own sake but a commitment to environmental and distributional justice: to forms of urban governance and decision-making that must balance competing voices and ideas about the city across space and time, in order to become truly sustainable.“Sus can identify disparities: exposure to heat island risk, for example, or walkable/unwalkable neighborhoods where seniors can safely walk and access things nearby,” says Manaugh. “It can identify trends, such as people with low incomes living in areas with poor access to healthcare or healthy food. That’s a very tangible concrete thing a policy maker can use to ask ‘what do we need to do about land or transport in these areas?’”Sustainable communitiesSus is made possible by McGill’s Sustainability Systems Initiative (MSSI), an initiative which provides opportunities for researchers from very different disciplines to interact and co-design projects that address complex issues from a variety of perspectives. Sus’s three academic leads, Wachsmuth, Manaugh, and Andrew Gonzalez, Professor and Liber Ero Chair in the McGill Department of Biology, and Founding director of the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science, were selected by MSSI to lead its Adapting Urban Environments research theme.“Andy is a biologist who’s interested in biodiversity and ecosystem services. David has a wealth of expertise about housing and urban governance, and most of my research is based around the idea of environmental justice and transportation equity,” says Manaugh. Sus draws on all their strengths to build something larger than the sum of its parts.“The researchers were given $1.2M over five years to develop a community around sustainability in the built environment,” says MSSI Director Dr. Heather McShane. In addition to the three leads, a team including graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow and full-time research scientist are involved with various aspects of the dashboard, such as coding and updating it with new data as it becomes available from public and private sources. “What’s exciting to me is Sus’s ability to take data sets that are not usually compatible and bring them into a compatible format you can look at in parallel together. It’s not that frequent that we can really point to knowledge to action. But this time we are really able to do so,” says McShane.The Sus dashboard will use open-source software and thus be easily adaptable to data sets from other cities and municipalities across Canada: there are already collaborations with Concordia, Université Laval, and the University of Toronto underway.Simple, user-friendly interfaceUltimately, apps and online tools live or die on their usability, but also the communities that they build around them. Sus already prioritizes a simple and user-friendly interface: its next goal is to engage the kinds of communities that will give it prolonged life.“The three of us are very closely connected to different types of user communities. I spend a lot of time talking to mayors, people who are leading the next iteration of their conservation plan, NGOs, foundations, citizen group movements, like the ruelles vertes (green alleyways) in Montreal: all these different ways of asking ‘how can we be more sustainable?’” says Gonzalez.“Biodiversity is one of the critical issues that cities are increasingly seeing as a part of a solution,” continues Gonzalez. “The functional diversity of green spaces that we manage and restore in an urban context can have a very positive health outcomes for people and nature. There’s a reciprocity between nature and people that is brought into sharp focus in a city. So a city like Montreal that has aspirations of protecting 17 per cent of its natural spaces, but has only protected 10 per cent so far, could benefit from a platform like Sus to guide those conversations.”Register for the April 25  launch event (in French)Register for the April 26 launch event (in English)","Tue, 04/19/2022 - 22:53"
Building pharmacological expertise in sub-Saharan Africa,"Square Alumni Foundation founder Philip Harrison speaks to a group of undergraduate pharmacology students at the University of Botswana. (Photo courtesy Philip Harrison)According to a recent report from the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), Africa has 17 per cent of the world’s population and 25 per cent of the world’s disease, but less than three per cent of the global health workforce. To help address this shortage, a McGill epidemiology professor has joined an effort to support pharmacological education throughout sub-Saharan Africa.Robert Platt, the Albert Boehringer (1st) Chair in Pharmacoepidemiology and Professor in both the Departments of Pediatrics and Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, is currently developing a series of five video lectures for the University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Pharmacological students and practicing pharmacists throughout sub-Saharan Africa use the videos as part of their education and training.Platt has completed one module on pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety research – his main area of expertise. A second module is in the works on polypharmacy, the simultaneous – and potentially dangerous – use of multiple prescription drugs at once.The video series is being done on behalf of the Square Alumni Foundation, a London-based charity organization that supports pharmacy education in sub-Saharan Africa. Platt serves on the Foundation’s Scientific Advisory Committee, which devises and coordinates the Foundation’s educational programs.The Square Alumni FoundationMcGill epidemiology professor Robert Platt. Photo courtesy of the Montreal Children’s HospitalThe Square Alumni Foundation is the brainchild of Philip Harrison, a British-born graduate of the University College London School of Pharmacy who emigrated to Montreal in 1976 to work as a pharmaceutical executive. Following his retirement in 2014, Harrison created the Foundation as a way of giving back to his profession, and providing important knowledge about potentially life-saving drugs to a part of the world drastically underserved by qualified pharmacists.“Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest region in the world by any health care measure, whether it’s GDP, maternal or infant mortality, or life expectancy,” Harrison says. “Ethiopia, for example, has a population of 118 million people. And there are as many pharmacists in Ethiopia as there are in the Montreal area, which has a population of roughly 4 million.”The report from the FIP, a global body which represents more than four million pharmacists, also claims the shortage of pharmacists across the continent means that about one-third of Africans do not have access to quality medicines or pharmaceutical services. Meanwhile, regulation and quality control around prescription drugs is also far less developed in Africa than it is elsewhere.“A good example is antibiotics, which are prescribed in a relatively structured way in North America,” Platt says. “There are concerns everywhere, including in North America, about overuse of antibiotics and what that might to do to things such as antibiotic resistance. Bringing that knowledge to pharmacists in Africa is important.”There is a growing demand for space in African universities for budding pharmacists, though many of them lack the resources to enter university. Donations to the Foundation help create scholarships for pharmacological students in Ethiopia, Namibia, Botswana and Malawi, with a possible expansion coming to Ghana and Uganda soon.Potential spinoffsDr. Platt’s involvement with the Foundation is helping to raise McGill University’s profile in these countries and helping to build relationships with educational institutions, which could soon provide opportunities for student and faculty exchanges between schools.“I’m excited about it,” Platt says. “McGill has a growing presence in global health. The possibilities are endless.”","Tue, 04/19/2022 - 10:20"
A wealth of research data ready for mining,"February 2022 marked an important milestone for the Quebec Inter-University Center for Social Statistics (QICSS) as it officially opened its new McGill-Concordia Research Data Centre (RDC) lab facility, along with a new Centre d’accès aux données de l’Institut de la Statistique du Québec (CADRISQ), in 680 Sherbrooke St. West.The RDC, one of 33 across the country, offers the McGill community a wealth of detailed research data from Statistics Canada which are not available to the general public. These microdata consists of observations at the level of individuals, households or businesses, and as a secure lab facility, the RDC ensures they are protected in a way that preserves confidentiality. Their value is in allowing the robust analysis of group differences, making possible the study of important and policy-relevant subgroup differences.While the microdata come primarily from Statistics Canada Survey Master files, RDCs also increasingly serve as repositories of administrative records from a variety of sources including tax, employment insurance, social assistance, and hospitalization records.The RDC also houses newer datasets with variables collected at the business level (e.g., the Business Research Microdata) or as a result of data linkages that combine information from different data sources together about the same individual (e.g., the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort – CanCHEC). In all, nearly 200 databases are made available to researchers, covering topics that vary from health, demography, immigration, labour markets, income inequality and poverty to the environment, Indigenous peoples, business, and travel and tourism (Get a complete list of datasets online).The opening of the CADRISQ, the RDC’s sister lab, provides access to ISQ survey microdata (from the Mininstère de la Santé et des Services Sociaux, Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec among others) will usher in new possibilities for McGill researchers to work with provincial confidential datasets.Serving more than 180 researchersThe first RDC at McGill opened in Peterson Hall back in 2006 under the stewardship of Professor Céline Le Bourdais, Distinguished James McGill Professor of Sociology. It grew considerably over the years to become one of the pillars of the QICSS network in the province. Today, with close to 70 on-going projects, the McGill-Concordia RDC serves more than 180 researchers making it the largest in terms of active users.The new lab facility at 680 Sherbrooke St. West was designed to accommodate this growing research community by providing a larger number of computer workstations to access the confidential datasets. With the support of the Office of the Vice-Principal (Research and Innovation), the planning phases of the new lab space project began in 2020 with construction undertaken the following year under the supervision of the lab’s new Academic Director, Professor Sébastien Breau, Associate Professor in the Department of Geography.Such an investment in high-level infrastructures positions McGill and the QICSS well in terms of its continued leadership in promoting the development of social statistics in Quebec and Canada, providing a cutting edge environment for research, contributing to evidence-based policy and decision making, and training the next generation of highly qualified personnel in the latest methods for quantitative analysis. The latter is particularly important as more than half of the 180 QICSS lab users are graduate students at McGill. To showcase some the innovative work they do, what follows are four vignettes of graduate students whose research relies on confidential data resources accessed via the RDC facility.Laëtitia RenéeLaëtitia Renée is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics (Faculty of Arts), under the supervision of Professor Fabian Lange. She studies the effects of different interventions promoting university attendance (financial aid, career counselling) on students’ long-term outcomes such as degree completion and earnings. Despite large institutional investments in such interventions, we do not know whether they effectively improve outcomes in the long run. The lack of knowledge of the effects on long-term outcomes stems from the fact that it is not easy to access reliable longitudinal data on students’ post-secondary education history and earnings. In her research, Laëtitia addresses this gap by taking advantage of unique administrative data of post-secondary institution records and income tax files available at the QICSS. These data allow her to study the effects of three interventions from the Future to Discover Project on students’ university enrollment, graduation, and earnings – from the end of high school through age 28. Her findings show that career education programs are effective in improving students’ outcomes in the long run. In contrast, she does not find evidence that providing students with additional financial support has any long-term monetary benefits, which is consistent with the fact that a number of grants and loans are already available in Canada. Laëtitia’s research is supported by funds from the Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture.Andrew StevensonAndrew Stevenson (@AndrStevenson) is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Geography (Faculty of Science), working under the supervision of Professor Nancy Ross. He studies how built environments “get under the skin” to affect the health and well-being of Canadians. With his colleague, Clara Kaufmann, he created the Canadian Food Environment Dataset (Can-FED), which is a dataset of neighbourhood-level retail food environment measures (e.g., proportion of fast-food outlets) derived using microdata from the Statistics Canada Business Register. Andrew has linked the Can-FED measures to individual-level data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey and the Canadian Community Health Survey to determine to what extent neighbourhood retail food environments are associated with diet and cardiometabolic health at the population level. Being able to link environmental data with rich individual-level health survey data through the Canadian Research Data Centre Network allows him and other researchers to investigate how social and environmental factors influence health at the population-level. Andrew is supported by funds from the Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Santé.Diego CapurroDiego Capurro is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Epidemiology (Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences), under the supervision of Professor Sam Harper. His research focuses on assessing changes in educational inequalities in cancer mortality over time and estimating the potential impact of reducing smoking inequality on the educational gradients in cancer mortality risk and years of life lost in the Canadian adult population. The recent creation of population-based cohorts through the linkage between census, health surveys, and mortality databases provides individual-level socioeconomic, health-related, and cause-specific mortality data and opens great opportunities to analyze cancer mortality inequality at the national level. Diego is supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Santé.Yvonne ChangYvonne Chang is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology (Faculty of Arts), under the supervision of Professor Thomas Soehl. Her research examines patterns in immigrants’ social inclusion in Canada and the salience of specific boundaries, such as region and language, to their experiences. She relies on the 2013 General Social Survey – Social Identity to explore how Canadian contexts relate to immigrants’ sense of national and subnational belonging, civic participation, and contact with friends. Her project is supported by doctoral research funding from the Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture, and detailed analyses would not be possible without access to the restricted dataset through the Quebec Interuniversity Centre for Social Statistics lab.For more information or questions regarding microdata resources available at the RDC, please contact Geneviève Brunet-Gauthier (genevieve.brunet-gauthier@mcgill.ca) or Professor Sébastien Breau (sebastien.breau@mcgill.ca).

Projections: Kwe now on display at McConnell Engineering Building,"Untitled (Young Couple Under the Snow), Leo Yerxa (1947- 2017), Ojibwe / Couchiching First Nation, Watercolour on paperA lot of people pass through the McConnell Engineering Building each day – bustling to and from class, the cafeteria and other destinations on the west side of campus.However, an important new addition to the lobby will give visitors pause to stop, look and admire.Launched on April 13, Projections: Kwe is a digital exhibit featuring 30 artworks from a variety of First Nations, Inuit and Métis artists projected onto the wall of the McConnell Engineering Building lobby. The exhibit will run for one year, after which the Faculty of Engineering and Visual Arts Collection will continue to collaborate and engage with different groups for upcoming Projections exhibits.In concert with Projections: Kwe, the Faculty of Engineering has installed two permanent artworks on the first floor of the McConnell Engineering Building from Benjamin Chee Chee: Afternoon Flight and Friends.Indigenous student-led initiativeMembers of the Indigenous Inclusion Committee (left to right): Jonas Henderson (Kalaaleq), Dallas Karonhia’no:ron Canady-Binette (Kanesatake’ro:non, Kanien’keha:ka), Isabelle Prévost-Aubin (Métis Nation), and Kayleigh Spencer (James Bay Cree)]The project was the brainchild of the Indigenous Inclusion Committee (IIC) of the Engineering Undergraduate Society. Founded by Isabelle Prévost-Aubin (Métis Nation), the IIC includes Dallas Karonhia’no:ron Canady-Binette (Kanesatake’ro:non, Kanien’keha:ka), Kayleigh Spencer (James Bay Cree), Jocelyne Couture (Métis Nation of Ontario), and Jonas Henderson (Kalaaleq).“As a collective of Indigenous students both within and outside of the Faculty of Engineering, the IIC came together to select the pieces of art that you see on display today,” said the IIC in its Curatorial Statement. “Of the utmost importance to the IIC was choosing works from different creative mediums, made by artists that hail from a variety of First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. Featured before you, for example, are a collection of paintings, such as Norval Morrisseau’s Shaman Surrounded by Ancestral Spirit Totem (1977), photographs, like those of Nadia Myre’s Meditations on Red (2013), and sculptures, like Tytoosie Tunnillie’s Sedna. This was done to highlight the longstanding diversity of Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island, as well as the rich and vibrant nature of Indigenous creativity.”Collaborative effortSupported by McGill’s Visual Arts Collection (VAC); the Dean’s Office of the Faculty of Engineering; and the Provost’s Indigenous Initiatives Office; the members of the IIC went through the University’s collection of Indigenous art, numbering some 140 pieces, in order to make the final selections.“During the selection process, the first critical criterion was the transparency of the history of the paintings, i.e. whether the artists and their Nations were explicitly known, as well as the manner in which the artwork was obtained by the University,” said Prévost-Aubin of the IIC. “Since different nations are recognized for various techniques within their art styles, and particularly given the format of this installation, we wanted to make sure the variety of artistry was a notable aspect of this project. Finally, the bicentennial values of indigenous resilience and excellence were emphasized during the selection of the artwork.”52 Calls to ActionIn his remarks, Provost Christopher Manfredi spoke of the efforts to integrate “Indigenous presence in new infrastructure and landscaping projects,” as per the 52 Calls to Action outlined in the Final Report of the Provost’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education.“The Projections: Kwe exhibit also speaks to that vision by displaying Indigenous artwork from McGill University’s own collection in public spaces. I am particularly pleased that this innovative digital exhibit was born out of an Indigenous student-led effort to raise intercultural awareness with their peers in the Faculty of Engineering. I commend them for their efforts, as well as the collaborative efforts between several units over the course of several months to see this project to fruition.”In the decision-making seatThe impact of having Indigenous art in such prominent display was not lost on Dayna Danger, McGill’s Mellon Indigenous Artist in Residence.“My experience has always been seeing other types of artwork and paintings of historical figures, but then all of a sudden you turn the corner and you see a [Saulteaux First Nations Artist] Robert Houle and an Anishinaabe painting. That’s fantastic,” said Danger. “Sharing our visual representation is really important because it lets people know that we’ve been here, we’ve always been here, and we want to inspire folks to make them think outside of the box.“My hope is that this inspires you to want to come and visit these artworks, sit with them, bring your favourite cup of tea, bring a coffee and look at the splendour that is the vast world of Indigenous art.”First step in a long journeyDuring the virtual launch, several speakers noted that Projections: Kwe can’t be seen as a one-off initiative. It is a stepping stone toward a more equitable and just society. There is more work – a lot more – to be done.Projections: Kwe “is a step toward making the Faculty [of Engineering] and McGill more inclusive to our Indigenous communities, [with an] emphasis on Indigenous voices within the professions of engineering, architecture, and urban planning. This is just one small step in a longer path that we must travel,” said Jim Nicell, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering. “The Faculty of Engineering has a key role to play in supporting our Indigenous students and building awareness within our programs to promote more equitable practices in the work of our professions.”“The Projections: Kwe art installation was formed collaboratively with the help of many perspectives, voices, and efforts. It is the step in the right direction but it is part of a much larger movement, a march for Indigenous rights, sovereignty and respect,” said Prévost-Aubin. “This project is meant to be one initiative among many and I look forward to seeing what other initiatives and resources the Faculty of Engineering implements for Indigenous students as well as their communities for the future years to come.”Get more information about Projections: KweWatch the virtual launch of Projections: Kwe","Thu, 04/14/2022 - 15:51"

His current research interests include nonlinear solid mechanics, vibrations, and fluid-structure interactionMarco Amabili, Canada Research Chair in Mechanical Vibrations in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, has been named a 2022 Guggenheim Fellow by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. This year, the Foundation honoured 180 artists, writers, scholars, and scientists from across the United States and Canada. Selected from a pool of nearly 2,500 applicants, the Fellows were appointed on the basis of prior achievement and exceptional promise.Elena Bennett, Canadian Research Chair in Sustainability Science, also was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.“Now that the past two years are hopefully behind all of us, it is a special joy to celebrate the Guggenheim Foundation’s new class of Fellows,” said Edward Hirsch, President of the Guggenheim Foundation and 1985 Fellow in Poetry. “This year marks the Foundation’s 97th annual Fellowship competition. Our long experience tells us what an impact these annual grants will have to change people’s lives. The work supported by the Foundation will aid in our collective effort to better understand the new world we’re in, where we’ve come from, and where we’re going. It is an honour for the Foundation to help the Fellows carry out their visionary work.”Since its establishment in 1925, the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship program has granted nearly $400 million in Fellowships to more than 18,000 individuals, including more than 125 Nobel laureates, winners of the Pulitzer Prize, Fields Medal, Turing Award, Bancroft Prize, National Book Award and other internationally recognized honours.Mechanics of the human aorta“It was a fantastic surprise to learn that I was selected for this award,” said the native of San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy. “I would like to thank all people who supported me.”Selected fellows receive individual grants to support the unfettered pursuit of their chosen field, according to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.“My research is in nonlinear solid mechanics, vibrations, and fluid-structure interaction,” said Amabili, who joined McGill in 2008. “One of the applications that has taken my interest in the recent years is the mechanics of the human aorta. My research group has done breakthrough progress in this area providing experimental results never obtained before. This research is aimed to the development of revolutionary aortic grafts that will help patients.

Rathlyn Fellowship recipients named,"Two graduate students in the Faculty of Education, Caitlin Gilpin and Christopher Reid, have been named as recipients of the Rathlyn Fellowship, given out each year to Indigenous graduate students at McGill to allow them to pursue a degree tied to the study of Canada. Each recipient of the Rathlyn Fellowship gets $25,000 to help cover the student’s expenses as they continue their education.The Rathlyn Fellowship is the brainchild of businessman and philanthropist Roger Warren who, with his late wife Mary, established the Rathlyn Foundation  in 1984 to support medical research, veterinary science, and education at institutions across Canada. Since then, the Foundation has endowed graduate and professional degree fellowships across several faculties. Warren was a recipient of an honorary Doctor of Laws at the Fall 2021 Convocation.The winnersCaitlin Gilpin was born and raised in the Cree community of Wemindji, Quebec, on the east coast of James Bay, about 1,400 kilometres north of Montreal. She is currently pursuing a Masters of Education in Educational Psychology, studying the concept of implicit theories of intelligence, based on the work of American psychologist and Stanford University professor Carol Dweck. During the three years she worked as a coordinator for a summer school for high school students in her community, Gilpin became convinced that intelligence isn’t something people are born with, but rather, that intelligence can be grown and nurtured.“I noticed students who would find stuff hard, and would just make negative attributions and stop trying,” Gilpin said. “My theory is that people with a more malleable view of intelligence do better in school – not necessarily because they’re smarter, but because when they hit obstacles, they see them as opportunities to learn.”Christopher Reid, of the Nisga’a nation, is completing a PhD in Educational Studies, focusing on urban Indigenous people’s experiences with land education, public schooling, and historical education. Reid is currently teaching a seminar dealing with Indigenous critiques of schooling and colonialism.Reid is also involved with several education-oriented Indigenous community projects in Montreal, including Restoring our Roots, which helps Indigenous youth reconnect with their culture and heritage, and Land as our Teacher, a five-year research project funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada which explores the benefits of land-based teachings for Indigenous young people. He also serves on the board of directors of Rising Sun Childcare Centre, the city’s only public daycare centre, whose mission is to provide educational and cultural programs for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children.Reid serves as a volunteer on the Steering Committee for Indigenous Climate Action, a national organization dedicated to finding solutions to climate change by taking the rights and the knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples into account.","Wed, 04/13/2022 - 09:54"
McCall MacBain Scholars announces 2022 cohort ,"Four of the new McCall MacBain Scholars (clockwise, from top left) Janelle Brown-Walkus, Linda Bùi, Portia Rayner and Will Stephenson Aspiring policymakers, health innovators, entrepreneurs, and non-profit leaders are among the 20 newly selected McCall MacBain Scholars at McGill, Canada’s comprehensive leadership scholarship program for master’s and professional studies.  The scholarship provides mentorship, coaching, a leadership curriculum, and full funding for a master’s or professional program at McGill. The funding covers the program’s tuition and fees, as well as a living stipend of $2,000 per month.  The new scholars will begin their degrees in seven faculties in September 2022. Three faculties – Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences, Education, and Management – will welcome scholars for the first time. “We need inclusive, collaborative, and forward-thinking leaders in all sectors and fields,” said John McCall MacBain, who, together with Marcy McCall MacBain, created these scholarships through a historic gift to McGill University. “With this scholarship, students will expand their networks, deepen their leadership skills, and benefit from full funding to pursue their dreams of improving their communities – and the world. Congratulations to these students and the hundreds of candidates across Canada who applied.”  Each scholar was chosen based on their character, community engagement, leadership potential, entrepreneurial spirit, academic strength, and intellectual curiosity.  “Our new scholars have taken different paths and will contribute unique perspectives to the scholarship community,” said Natasha Sawh, Dean of the McCall MacBain Scholarships. “The selection committees looked for a willingness to engage with diverse perspectives, and traits like empathy, integrity, and grit. Our process incorporates a wide range of volunteer readers and interviewers, who understand the candidates and their varied experiences.”  More than 130 Canadian leaders volunteered their time to help select McCall MacBain Scholars. They reviewed nearly 700 applications, interviewed 146 students regionally, and invited 50 to a final set of interviews that took place in March. Four McGill recipients This year, four McGillians made the cut. Aastha Goyal is finishing her Bachelor of Engineering degree, and will be joined by recent McGill grads Janelle Brown-Walkus (BSc ’18), Michelle Hahn-Baker (BA ’20) and Shirley Wang (BSc ’20). While pursuing her undergraduate studies at McGill, Brown-Walkus helped run AISES, a campus group for Indigenous students in STEM, and co-coordinated First Nations, Métis, and Inuit youth outreach for the Let’s Talk Science chapter. Last year, she completed a Master of Science in Dentistry in 2021 at the University of Toronto, where she wrote a thesis on First Nations perceptions of quality preventive oral health care in Indigenous communities. “Throughout my academics, I have listened and learned about the kind of dentist I would like to become,” says Brown-Walkus, who will enter McGill’s Undergraduate Dental Program (DMD) in September. “During my professional program, I hope to hone the skills to become that dentist while also working with my colleagues and peers to improve dental care for Indigenous peoples across Canada.” A cross-Canada cohort In all, students from 17 Canadian universities are represented in the 2022 cohort – the final group of scholars to come exclusively from Canadian universities. Starting in June 2022, students pursuing their degrees in schools outside Canada will be able to apply for one of the 2023 McCall MacBain Scholarships. One of this year’s scholars, William Stephenson, from Beamsville, Ontario, is completing his Bachelor of Commerce from McMaster University, and hopes to apply his knowledge of business tools to empower non-profit organizations and social entrepreneurs. He is looking forward to pursuing his Master of Management in Analytics in the fall. “Attending the final interviews was an enriching experience,” Stephenson says. “It was my first time in Montreal, and I was able to explore parts of the city and the McGill campus. The highlight of the experience was meeting the other finalists. This interdisciplinary group brought so much passion and unique perspectives that I left the final interviews having learned an abundance from my fellow finalists.” Linda Bùi graduated from University of Toronto Scarborough in 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts in International Development Studies. In her hometown of Brampton, Ontario, she co-founded and led several youth engagement initiatives, including the Girls Empowerment Movement, which provides mentorship and empowerment opportunities for racialized young women. She also spearheaded a climate justice discussion series and a photo-voice project to engage young Vietnamese women in conversations about cultural identities, gender, and leadership. She currently works in government relations at the Council of Ontario Universities, and will pursue a Master of Public Policy at McGill.   “The application process provided me with a unique opportunity to dream big, reflect on leadership experiences and highlight the work of my communities in-depth with new learnings along the way,” she said. “Regardless of the outcome, to be a part of this journey is a memorable and moving experience for all!”  Portia Rayner is another 2022 scholar focused on empowering young women–specifically, encouraging young women to pursue studies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Currently finishing her mechanical engineering undergrad at the University of Alberta, Rayner’s extensive volunteer activities includes mobilizing a team to create Ada Code Challenge, a workshop that introduces girls to the fundamentals of programming hardware. “Volunteerism builds community by providing the opportunity to ‘pay it forward,’” she says. “My research interests were generously supported by several mentors. It inspired me to actively promote STEM to younger generations and traditionally underrepresented groups.”Rayner will pursue a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at McGill. As a former elite athlete, she is keen to help develop technologies for injury prevention and treatment.

Elena Bennett awarded prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship,"Elena Bennett is McGill’s Canadian Research Chair in Sustainability ScienceTom DiSandolo Elena Bennett has been named a 2022 Guggenheim Fellow. Bennett, the Canadian Research Chair in Sustainability Science, is one of 180 new Guggenheim Fellows, representing 51 scholarly disciplines and artistic fields.The prestigious Guggenheim Fellowships are intended for mid-career individuals who have demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability in the arts and exhibit great promise for their future endeavours.Marco Amabili, Canada Research Chair in Mechanical Vibrations in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, was also awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.“Now that the past two years are hopefully behind all of us, it is a special joy to celebrate the Guggenheim Foundation’s new class of Fellows,” said Edward Hirsch, President of the Guggenheim Foundation and 1985 Fellow in Poetry. “This year marks the Foundation’s 97th annual Fellowship competition.

It is an honour for the Foundation to help the Fellows carry out their visionary work.”Focus on ecosystem services“I’m honestly thrilled,” said Bennett, who is jointly appointed in the Bieler School of Environment and the Department of Natural Resource Sciences. “The idea of the Guggenheim Fellowship is to help fellows find the swaths of time that are so rare for all of us in our busy lives these days and that are required to think deeply about hard topics and undertake novel and exciting projects.“I’ve wanted for a while to write a book that explores the notion that the world could be better because people are in it (rather than better despite people being here). But I’ve never been able to make the time for it, and there is a lot of learning involved about the logistics of book writing (as opposed to manuscript writing, which I’m more familiar with),” Bennett told the Reporter. “Luckily for me, the stars seem to be aligning because I was also recently invited to be part of the first cohort of participants in the Wrigley Storymakers program. This program, the brainchild of Joe Arvai, organized by Liz Neeley of Liminal Creations, and taught in part by Pulitzer Prize winner Ed Yong, is designed to help its fellows develop a creative storytelling project that involves narrative persuasion.”Research in the Bennett lab centers around questions about ecosystem services, and the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. Bennett’s areas of expertise include sustainable use and management of biodiversity and ecosystem services; multi-functional landscapes; human impacts on biogeochemical cycles; management of tradeoffs among ecosystem services, especially agricultural production and water quality; global food security, agriculture and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; land use change and water quality; and urban ecology.Stellar companyCreated and initially funded in 1925 by Senator Simon and Olga Guggenheim in memory of their son John Simon Guggenheim, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation has sought since its inception to “further the development of scholars and artists by assisting them to engage in research in any field of knowledge and creation in any of the arts, under the freest possible conditions.”Since its establishment, the foundation has granted nearly $400 million in Fellowships to more than 18,000 individuals, including more than 125 Nobel laureates, winners of the Pulitzer Prize, Fields Medal, Turing Award, Bancroft Prize, National Book Award and other internationally recognized honours.Read the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation press release","Tue, 04/12/2022 - 00:08"
Measuring climate and its change at McGill since 1874,"The McGill Observatory was founded by Dr. Charles Smallwood in 1863 and demolished in 1963 to make way for the Leacock Building. The McGill Bieler School of Environment has announced its first annual round of Spark and Ignite funded research projects. Spark and Ignite are ongoing funding programs designed to help the BSE continue its important work to find interdisciplinary solutions to complex environmental challenges. Among the projects is one that examines climate measurements at the McGill Observatory going back 150 years.Citizen scientists“From 1863 to 1992 McGill ran a weather observatory that collected precious information: weather measurements of all kinds, many times a day. These measurements are in logbooks, and though the logbooks have been scanned on microfilm, and digitized into images, they’re not in a form that is usable,” explains Professor Frédéric Fabry, Bieler School of Environment and Department of Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences.The task of transcribing the McGill Weather Observatory logbooks, which represent one of the most complete weather observation data sets in Canada (an estimated 9 million sub-daily measurements) is estimated to take ~50,000 hours – the work lifetime of a person. Logbooks like these exist worldwide and form the most direct measures of climate change we have. For the last five years, the Data Rescue: Archives & Weather (DRAW) initiative has convened a group of students and volunteer “citizen scientists” to carry out these transcriptions.“There is a field of research called ‘citizen science,’ where non- or lay experts have been contributing to science for a very long time,” explains Associate Professor Renee Sieber, Bieler School of Environment and Department of Geography, and one of DRAW’s scientific leads, along with Fabry and others. “The UK a few years ago celebrated the 150th anniversary of citizen science that they traced back to ‘ramblers,’ who would take evening walks and contribute to the field of phenology (the detection of seasonal changes), for example noting when the crocuses and snowdrops bloomed and daffodils and trees lost their leaves. Activities like the Christmas Bird count from the Audubon Society have been ongoing for over 100 years. Amateurs have been taking very careful observations that have become the backbone of certain sciences, such as ornithology, particularly around the transnational migration of birds.”Victoria Slonosky, PhD, an independent scholar and historical climatologist who uses past records of weather and climate to analyze and evaluate climate change and variability, is DRAW’s project lead. “After studying historical climatology, I collected a number of historical weather records for Canada in the early 2000s as a post-doc and early career researcher,” says Slonosky. “Prior to DRAW, I started a citizen science project to transcribe these records in 2010. Three centuries of temperature records were published in 2014 for the St. Lawrence Valley. After hearing about the results of the project, researchers at McGill were interested in putting together a similar project for the McGill Observatory records.”Transcribing more than a century of weatherThe McGill DRAW project allows volunteers to participate in the transcription of historical weather logs captured at the McGill weather observatory since 1874, the year when it came under the umbrella of the Meteorological Service of Canada. The weather information contained in these logbooks must be transcribed in a digital format to be used for scientific research. Slonosky oversees a team of transcribers (including four “super-users” who have transcribed 100s of pages and 83 per cent of the transcriptions), and reviews and analyzes the observations, occasionally filling in gaps and correcting or amending details.Logbook symbol “U” for “ugly” (or, potentially threatening) weather. The DRAW project also built its own transcription platform to handle the sheer density of observations in the handwritten ledger sheets. One of the transcribers is graduate student Giuliana Garofalo, who is pursuing a Masters of Information Studies (specializing in archival and preservation studies) at McGill and is currently DRAW’s outreach assistant, having joined the team nine months ago.“I allocate time each week to transcribing logbook pages,” says Garofalo. “I prefer to transcribe pages with qualitative data – some pages have ‘Remarks’ columns – and so I spend more time deciphering handwriting than those who prefer to transcribe quantitative data. The ability to decipher handwriting is sometimes challenging, especially when faced with ink stains or fading, but once you get the hang of it, you’re able to uncover valuable insight into observers’ perceptions of the weather. To date, my favorite finding is from 22 April 1879, where the observer wrote ‘Maple trees budding.’”The descriptions of weather phenomena within these logbooks are highly detailed and extend far beyond observations on clear or cloudy skies, or temperature, barometer and precipitation measurements. Scientists at the McGill Observatory used over thirty symbols to describe the weather, ranging from thunderstorms and hail to hoar frost and dust haze. “There are even different symbols to distinguish light, heavy, and torrential rain. My personal favorite symbol is ‘U’, which denotes ‘ugly’ or, potentially threatening weather,” says Garofalo.Professors Fabry and Sieber’s Ignite project Taking Environmental Citizen Science Contributions to the Next Level represents a new phase of the work, and concerns an assessment of the accuracy of the logbook transcriptions. Drawing on Fabry’s expertise in meteorological data management and and Sieber’s expertise in non-expert use of technologies, the project will use multiple methods, including writing code to automate the process, creating metadata (descriptive data about data) to generate an audit trail for any modifications to the database, sampling the output and assessing the validity of the method. “The challenge we now face is that the transcriptions are of unknown quality, in part because the original transcription used shorthand, or is unreadable, or contains transcription errors,” says Fabry.The researchers are now at the stage where they have enough information transcribed to work on the data quality and in the process learn how accurate the transcription from the citizen scientists is. When it comes to the value of the data, Sieber is unequivocal about its importance: “This is the only direct empirical evidence of climate change. Everything else is a surrogate or proxy for climate change.”“Most people who’ve transcribed data only do daily averages,” concludes Fabry. “We are daring to take all the measurements – over 1.5 million unvalidated observations (and growing) transcribed to date – which is why our transcription is a lot slower than many others. The inconvenience is that it takes much longer and that’s why we need all this help to determine its accuracy.”Sign up here to become a DRAW user","Mon, 04/11/2022 - 16:57"
"McGill’s Visiting Elders offer guidance, mentorship to Indigenous students","Geraldine Standup and son Mike began their mandate as Visiting Elders at McGill in January 2021Neale McDevitt When Terry Young talks about Geraldine and Mike Standup, prominent Elders and Healers from Kahnawake, his admiration is obvious.“They are renowned everywhere, not only in their community,” says Young, Program Manager, Indigenous Studies and Community Engagement Initiative (ISCEI). “But you would never know it from them. They are just so humble. But the impact that they have made on the lives of hundreds, even thousands of people, is incredible.”“It was so important to bring them to McGill because we wanted the students to have the opportunity to learn from them.”The mother-son duo has been serving as the inaugural Visiting Elders at McGill since January 2021, providing guidance and mentorship to Indigenous students.Managed by the ISCEI, the program is one of the initiatives supported by the US$1.25-million gift to McGill made by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2019.The Elder’s role includes:Facilitating Sharing Circles, where participants are given a safe space to discuss issues they are experiencing in a positive and supportive group setting;Providing personal consultation, conversation, guidance, and mentorship;Providing cultural and spiritual support through one-on-one guidance sessions;Sharing knowledge and expertise in different areas through cultural teachings; andOffering access to medicines and smudge.Speaking their truthBecause of the pandemic, the Standups have done the bulk of their consultations virtually, although Mike has managed to hold a number of in-person sessions on campus.“They are very personal issues,” says Geraldine. “Many new students have trouble adjusting. They have moved outside their milieu and into a highly cosmopolitan cityscape. They are trying to find a niche for themselves. I encourage them to come out of their shell and speak their truth, whatever that may be, because it’s worth hearing. It’s helping students adjust to their new environment.”“The well-seasoned students are really political beings. A lot of our discussions have to do with issues of honesty and integrity. Of course, it’s been very interesting for me, because I have an opinion on everything,” she says laughing.The program is based in First Peoples’ House, a place Mike knows well.“I was working for First People’s House way back in 2009 or 2010. That was my first taste of working with university students and I enjoyed it very much,” says Mike.“Many times, I help people remember their power, and connect with their good mind,” he says. “People lose that connection for various reasons, sometimes through trauma or tragedy. When I consult with them, I’m mostly listening. I really try to give them a platform to find their voice and speak about what is troubling them, what their motivations are, and what their dreams are.”Forged in fireBoth Geraldine and Mike underwent a period of enlightenment in and around 1990, during challenging times in their respective lives.“It was an entirely spiritual experience, a metamorphosis into a larger understanding. This is what native people are all about – we are highly spiritual beings,” Says Geraldine. “It was a transition from living a purely physical life and moving into a broader vision of what the world, our life, and our place in it really is.”“Observing my mom’s spiritual awakening was an important event for myself as well, because I was viewing the turmoil that she went through, but it was also my own turmoil at the same time,” says Mike. “That whole being-forged-in-fire kind of thing helps you develop an understanding of what is hurting people because you’re experiencing it.Finding the power withinOne of the common issues the Standups address is what they call the “decolonization process.” People come to them in crisis, looking for a diagnosis as to what is wrong with them, and, of course, a remedy. The entire process, they say, strips the person of their personal power.“The key factor in our approach to healing is that we’re not looking for problems. We’re seeing you as whole and complete,” says Mike. “We’re not looking for sickness. We’re advising you of your wholeness and wellbeing. And that causes an immediate change in a person, because they’ve been taught to see, and fear, the weakness in themselves.”“Where they see illness, we see transition,” says Geraldine.“It’s about decolonizing. Our people have been lied to for 500 years,” says Geraldine. “They’re beginning to think that the only solutions are found in [Western] medicine, psychiatry, and psychology.“But we had our own way. We had our own way and we were healthy people. So why are we sick now? We have re-learn how to think – and the best way to learn how to think is to go back to your language, because everything that you need to know and understand about life exists in the language,” says Geraldine.Grand awakening“We’re here to provide that teaching, but also to teach them the ability to heal themselves,” says Mike. “We don’t want people to become dependent on the healer because they have the power themselves.“This is part of our decolonization process. It’s a really big one because so many people need another person to connect to God, right? You don’t need a middleman, you have your own power already to do that,” continues Mike.This is part of the grand awakening of many people at this time – not just Native people – we’ve all been colonized to a certain extent, and it doesn’t matter, which continent you come from.”","Thu, 04/07/2022 - 15:53"

Sustainable Sparks: Madhav Badami on uniting all sides of sustainability,"One of the greatest strengths of the McGill Environment Studies program is its emphasis on interdisciplinary work, and Madhav Badami, PhD, is no exception. Badami began his career in mechanical engineering, but his drive to make a change in the world led him into teaching at McGill’s School of Urban Planning and the Bieler School of Environment. Through his work in and outside the classroom, Badami is able to share his ideas of collective action and learning for the future with hundreds of students every year. On top of this, his involvement with the Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) connects him with initiatives on all corners of our campuses. The SPF is the largest fund of its kind in Canada, valued at $1 million annually, and has the mandate to build a culture of sustainability on McGill’s campuses through the seed funding of interdisciplinary projects. Badami shared his unique pedagogy in a sit down with the Office of Sustainability.As an instructor, you are tasked with introducing students to the topic of the environment in their first years of study. What are some of your philosophies about teaching learners about sustainability?Professor Madhav Badami has a joint appointment in the School of Urban Planning and the Bieler School of EnvironmentSiddhi Aubeeluck There are various kinds of knowledge and analytical skills that are useful for understanding issues related to environment and sustainability, and to address them effectively. Because these issues involve scientific-technological, but also socio-economic, political-institutional, human behavioural, and ethical dimensions, I draw on perspectives from multiple disciplines to investigate them along these dimensions.I also demonstrate the importance of addressing these issues [through the lens that] people really matter. This means, firstly, trying to understand – with humility – why people make the choices that they do in relation to resources and the environment.Secondly, in order to develop and implement policies that are effective and equitable, I discuss the importance of carefully considering how people might be affected by and will likely respond to them.Lastly, because these issues are characterized by multiple groups in society with conflicting interests and concerns, and a range of impacts that affect these groups differentially, I discuss collaborative approaches for reconciling these interests and concerns, and conflicts and trade-offs between these impacts from the perspective of various groups.I use case studies to show the usefulness – and limitations – of the theoretical concepts and analytical approaches I discuss, and real-life examples from a range of contexts of the challenges in addressing these issues, and how they were surmounted.You also just finished your mandate on the SPF Governance Council. Can you tell me a bit about what you enjoyed about your role there?I think that the SPF is just terrific and it’s allowing a lot of really good work to happen at McGill. It’s great to see students and staff from different units across the University coming together to propose very interesting projects that aim to solve various sustainability-related issues on campus.My participation on the Governance Council has been an enjoyable but also educational experience for me. We get the opportunity to evaluate these funding proposals in terms of their environmental, socio-economic and equity aspects, as well as their feasibility and their potential for long-term impact.I particularly love that the council is made up of faculty, staff and students from different units across the University. As I said, you need to include a wide range of perspectives on these issues, and that is precisely what ends up happening in these council meetings.Your position is unique in McGill in the sense that your involvement is not bound to one school. What has working between departments allowed you to do in terms of sustainability? Do you believe that this collaborative approach is more effective in tackling environmental and social issues?I think it’s a really exciting place to be. My joint appointment in the School of Urban Planning and [the Bieler School of] Environment, both of which are highly inter-disciplinary fields, allows me to interact with people working on a wide range of issues from various perspectives. But even more importantly, it allows me to engage with students from a range of backgrounds. For example, in my graduate environmental policy and planning class, I have students in urban planning and environment, but also from the sciences, engineering, international development, law, urban systems, bioresource engineering – you name it – who come together to learn about and work on these important issues. It creates an amazing mutual learning experience for both myself and the students.The issues we are dealing with in the world right now…. You can’t just put them in a disciplinary box. You need to integrate perspectives drawn from multiple disciplines in order to really understand and address them effectively. This is not to say that work on these issues within disciplines is not important — we absolutely need these efforts to find solutions – but there are certain aspects of sustainability that you just can’t understand without looking at the whole picture. It’s not “either-or”; it’s “both-and.”As someone who is so integral to sustainable education at McGill, what message do you want to share with the McGill community?Just because you aren’t in environmental studies doesn’t mean you don’t have a place in sustainability. If I had been asked 20-30 years ago if I could have ever imagined that I would be where I am today, I would have said, “Not in my wildest dreams.” I encourage you to find the best way that you can develop your own nuanced way of thinking about these issues that reflect their complexity and share them whenever you can.Secondly, moral concern – and even outrage – is important, because it helps you move towards action. I want to emphasize the importance of hard thinking, as [American ecological economist] Herman Daly did many years ago, to focus on coming up with practical, feasible ways to reconcile different affected groups in society.Along with moral outrage, I also want to emphasize the importance of realistic optimism. Yes, there are all kinds of challenges, and the solutions are not going to be easy, but it’s important to remember that positive change is possible, and in fact, it’s happening right now.","Tue, 04/05/2022 - 13:16"
$2.9 million from the Government of Canada for McGill Research,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive effect on McGill’s research activities, particularly community and field-based research. The pandemic has also provided a unique opportunity to explore new directions in research methodologies. McGill’s researchers have developed creative solutions and harnessed science to solve national and global challenges.On April 4, the Government of Canada released the results of the New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF) 2021 Exploration competition and the NFRF special call on innovative approaches to research in the pandemic context. The New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF) competitions are designed to fund “high-risk, high-reward research that pushes boundaries.” Twelve McGill projects were funded for a total of $2.9 million. The projects funded through the special call are focused on community and field-based research, and on data collection efforts stalled during the pandemic. Projects funded through the Exploration competition have the potential to yield innovative results in social, cultural, economic, health-related, and technological areas.Pandemic-proof Arctic research The COVID-19 lockdown disrupted much of Arctic ecosystem science, but especially seabird research. With NFRF rapid-response funding, a project led by Professor Kyle Elliot (Natural Resource Sciences) with co-applicant McGill Professor Mélanie Guigueno (Biology), and collaborators from the University of Windsor and Environment and Climate Change Canada, aims to develop new approaches to seabird field work and data collection in the Canadian Arctic. Elliot is developing pandemic-proof techniques for safe data collection by local community members. Among the techniques under development are drones with machine learning applications, and fixed cameras, to study seabird colony dynamics.Black holes on-a-chipWith funding from the Exploration competition, a multidisciplinary effort led by Professor Guillaume Gervais (Physics), Professor Thomas Szkopek (Electrical and Computer Engineering) and Associate Professor Walter Reisner (Physics) will attempt to create sonic black holes — “black holes on-a-chip” — to conduct laboratory studies and shed light on the long sought-after Hawking predictions of these mysterious celestial objects. The team also anticipates their efforts will generate new fundamental knowledge on fluid mechanics and general relativity.Protecting old-growth forests demands a rapid responseWith the funding provided by the NFRF Exploration competition, McGill biology professor Catherine Potvin and other McGill co-applicants, Assistant Professor Yann le Polain de Waroux (Institute for the Study of International Development and Department of Geography), and Julie Major, (Lecturer, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences), will work with the Asociación de Mujeres Artesanas de Ipeti-Emberá (AMARIE), an Indigenous women’s organization, to explore carbon offsetting and the monitoring of old growth forests in partnership with Indigenous communities in eastern Panama. The funds will support capacity building workshops in computer literacy and emerging technology, as well as in traditional participatory models of knowledge gathering, all in service of transitioning to an economy centred around the forest.These efforts will complement the Bayano-McGill Reforestation Project, also in eastern Panama, which has allowed the Emberá community to plant more than 30,000 trees since the project’s establishment in 2020, amounting to 30 hectares of land reforested. By offsetting a portion of the University’s greenhouse gas emissions, this progress contributes to McGill’s long-term target to become carbon neutral by 2040.Insects in the fight against cancerAmong gynecological cancers, ovarian cancer results in the highest mortality and is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. New therapeutic options are urgently needed, and Professor Ehab Abouheif (Biology) has a novel idea. Honeybee societies can suffer from ‘social cancer’, which occurs when workers reproduce uncontrollably and stop working. However, the queen helps maintain social harmony by emitting an inhibitory pheromone called ‘Queen Mandibular Pheromone’ (QMP) that stops workers from reproducing by inhibiting growth and inducing programmed cell death in their ovaries. Remarkably, QMP also inhibits ovary development in distantly related animals.Abouheif and co-applicants Associate Professor Michael Witcher (Department of Oncology and the Jewish General Hospital), Professor Paul Lasko (Biology), and University of Western Ontario Associate Professor Graham Thompson (Biology) will test the hypothesis that honeybee QMP can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells, in much the same way that it suppresses ovarian development in worker honeybees. Should this theory prove viable, there is potential to uncover an entirely new class of chemotherapeutics to fight ovarian cancer. This study was funded through the NFRF Special Call.List of McGill projects awarded in the 2021 NFRF Special Call competition:Principal Investigator: Kyle Elliot, Department of Natural Resource SciencesMcGill Co-Applicant: Mélanie Guigueno, Department of BiologyProject: Innovative and Resilient Approaches to Seabird Field Work in the Canadian ArcticFunding: $250,000Principal Investigator: Jorge Fritz, Department of Microbiology and ImmunologyProject: Identification of B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV2-specific antibodiesFunding: $240,000Principal Investigator: Anna Hargreaves, Department of BiologyProject: Distributed experiments to overcome pandemic lockdowns while promoting equity, diversity and global knowledgeFunding: $240,000Principal Investigator: Richard Hovey, Faculty of Dentistry and Oral Health SciencesProject: Applied Philosophical Hermeneutics Research: the Hermeneutic WagerFunding: $240,000Principal Investigator: Catherine Potvin, Department of BiologyProject: From carbon to forests for life: Towards sustainable Indigenous engagementFunding: $240,000Principal Investigator: Brittany Wenniserí:iostha Jock, Department of Human NutritionMcGill Co-Applicants: Treena Wasonti:io Delormier, School of Human Nutrition/Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental SciencesProject: Integrating Indigenous knowledge systems into health research: supporting community engagement, program evaluation, and knowledge translationFunding: $240,000Principal Investigator: Jérome Waldispuhl, School of Computer ScienceProject: A mobile gaming platform to accelerate flow cytometry data analysisFunding: $240,000Exploration competition: Principal Investigator: Ehab Abouheif, Department of BiologyMcGill Co-Applicants: Michael Witcher, Department of Oncology and the Jewish General Hospital; Paul Lasko, Department of BiologyProject: Exploring Social Insect Pheromones as a New Chemotherapeutic to Fight CancerFunding: $250,000Principal Investigator: Hsin Chiang, Department of PhysicsProject: A Flexible Drone-Based Measurement Platform for Astrophysics and GlaciologyFunding: $250,000Principal Investigator: Guillaume Gervais, Department of PhysicsMcGill Co-Applicant: Thomas Szkopek, Department of Electrical and Computer EngineeringProject: Physics of black holes on-a-chipFunding: $250,000Principal Investigator: Adrien Peyrache, Department of Neurology and NeurosurgeryMcGill Co-Applicant: Blake Richards, School of Computer ScienceProject: The role of the retrosplenial cortex in orienting cognitive maps.Funding: $250,000Principal Investigator: Natalie Reznikov, Department of BioengineeringMcGill Co-Applicants: Didem Dagdeviren, Faculty of Dentistry and Oral Health Sciences; Marc McKee, Faculty of Dentistry and Oral Health SciencesProject: Upsampling of low-resolution/large-volume 3D tomographic images using generative adversarial neural networks applied to medical imaging, biological anthropology and evolutionary biologyFunding: $250,000","Tue, 04/05/2022 - 12:36"
Submissions open for Montreal International Poetry Prize,"Established poets, writers who dabble, and people who have never penned a poem but have long felt their inner muse calling, take note: the Montreal International Poetry Prize is back.Organized by McGill’s Department of English, the competition is held every two years and awards a prize of $20,000 to an original poem of forty lines or less.“What’s exciting about this prize is it is tapping into the life and energy of poetry,” says Eli MacLaren, Associate Professor, Department of English, and Director of the 2022 competition. “Poetry is for everyone. It works its way into countless things we do, from prayer and meditation, to pop music, to media and advertising. Even scientific explanations frequently have recourse to metaphor and strive for the richest expression in the most concise terms. That’s poetry.“So many people submit to this competition. The cash prize is a measure of their participation,” says MacLaren. “Meanwhile, at the backend, the economics of this non-profit undertaking allow us to employ a team of McGill students to help run the competition. It’s making a material difference in their lives, too. At its best, the Montreal Prize is a literary community and an economic structure for the energy of people’s poetic creativity.”Celebrating the power and play of languageFounded in 2010, the Montreal Prize is a non-profit institution dedicated to the poem as an art form. The Montreal Prize is crowdfunded rather than endowed: it is paid for by poets for the benefit of poets. The entry fee is $20 CAD by the deadline of May 1 ($25 for the later deadline of May 15). Multiple submissions per poet (at the reduced rate of $17) are welcome. Entrants have the option of making a donation to sponsor the entry of a fellow poet somewhere else in the world who cannot afford the fee.The 2020 competition drew over 5,000 entries from around the world. The language of the competition is English, and the international jury is open to “world Englishes,” i.e., to the diversity of the English language as it is spoken in different regions today.“Language is central to who we are, and poetry invites us to explore how language works – to see its power and its play, to sift our experiences through it, to slow us down and renew our sympathy,” says MacLaren. “Through the intelligence and emotion of poetry, we consciously bend language to reflect our lives, find clarity, and examine our deepest selves.”Biggest single-poem prize in the worldThe judging of this competition is blind. The jurors who select the finalists, and the single judge who chooses the winner, do not know the names of the authors as they read the poems. It is meant to accent the creation of the new poem, rather than any author’s prior achievements or celebrity status.The $20,000 prize, believed to be the highest monetary award given for a single poem, is intended to make a real difference in the life and career of a working poet. The judge who will award it to one winning poem is Lorna Goodison, poet laureate of Jamaica (2017–20) and recipient of the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry (2019). Goodison’s many collections include Collected Poems (2017), Supplying Salt and Light (2013), Goldengrove: New and Selected Poems (2006), and Controlling the Silver (2005),This year’s jurors are: Michael Prior, Liz Howard, Medrie Purdham (Canada), Cameron Awkward-Rich, Heather Christle (USA), Joanne Limburg, Rhian Williams (UK), Conor O’Callaghan (Ireland), Tanure Ojaide (Nigeria), Nabina Das (India), and Mark Tredinnick (Australia). Tredinnick was the winner of the inaugural Montreal Prize, awarded in 2011, and his latest collection, Walking Underwater (2021), was titled in honour of that prize-winning poem.Throughout the current entry period, judge and jurors are introducing themselves and their work in an online reading series, “Fluid Vessels.” Five events are scheduled, each consisting of fifteen-minute readings by two or three of these poets, followed by questions from the moderators and audience. The events are free and open to the public. The schedule and registration instructions can be found on Eventbrite.Labour of love for McGill English DepartmentAll of the poems selected by the jury, approximately sixty in total, will be published in The Montreal Poetry Prize Anthology 2022. The last anthology, published by Véhicule Press of Montreal as part of their Signal Editions series, included poems from the Bahamas, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Kenya, the Philippines, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom.The Montreal Prize is administered by a team of faculty and students in McGill’s Department of English. MacLaren, Director of this year’s competition, teaches poetry, Canadian literature, and the history of the book. Graduate students Martin Breul, Jeremy Desjarlais, and Andy Perluzzo, and undergraduates Lowell Wolfe, Savannah Sguigna, and Lizzie Schulz, have played key roles in organizing and publicizing the initiative over the past year. Professor Alexander Manshel, who has published on American literature, the sociology of literature, and prize culture, helped recruit this year’s jury. Pascale Théorêt-Groulx, a Montreal installation-and-performance artist, has provided technical support.More information about the Montreal Prize can be found at its web site www.montrealpoetryprize.com: a link to the submission platform, the rules and regulations of the competition, shortlisted and winning poems from past competitions, and audio files of poets reading their work. News about the prize, including events and the announcement of the winner, can be found on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

Agricultural biodiversity and nutrient footprints,"Brian Leung and Fiona SoperThe McGill Bieler School of Environment has announced its first annual round of Spark and Ignite funded research projects. Spark and Ignite are ongoing funding programs designed to help the BSE continue its important work to find interdisciplinary solutions to complex environmental challenges. Among the projects are two that examine agricultural biodiversity and nutrient footprints – from McGill campuses to Panama City.Increasing agricultural biodiversity “Every person on earth relies on agriculture,” says Fiona Soper, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Bieler School of Environment and Department of Biology, describing the realization that caused her to expand her research focus from strictly natural to production systems. “Today, virtually all of the world’s staple crops are produced in mostly mono-cropped annual agricultural systems started from scratch from bare ground every year.”This requires extensive management and continually disrupts the ability of the soil to support diverse biological communities and sequester carbon. Perennial crops on the other hand (such as the newly developed perennial alternative to wheat, Kernza) can be grown in a way that more closely mimics natural carbon-sequestering grassland systems: they require far less farmer intervention and include biodiverse species mixtures with complimentary ecological roles.“Because these growing systems are still new and not yet widely adopted by the agricultural community, we are in a phase of active research to understand – and optimize – how they function and develop guidelines for producers.”Soper’s Spark project, Nitrogen Dynamics in a Novel Perennial, Biodiverse Cropping System, will be conducted with Cynthia Kallenbach (Assistant Professor in the Department of Natural Resource Sciences and Bieler School of Environment Associate Member) and Jessica Nicksy (Department of Natural Resource Sciences and Kallenbach lab PhD student), across both McGill Downtown and Macdonald campuses. Its goal is to measure how incorporating legumes, which create their own fertilizer from the air, into cropping mixtures, can replace human-made fertilizers and improve soil functioning.“Much of the work of developing these perennial cropping systems so far has revolved around their ability sequester soil carbon, and this project builds on existing work on carbon being done at McGill by the Kallenbach lab,” says Soper. “In our new collaboration, I am bringing my expertise in nutrient cycling, usually applied to tropical forests, to also assess how nutrient dynamics can be optimized in these new cropping systems. Incorporating legumes into these cropping mixtures has been proposed as a way to increase nutrient supply to the crop, but the mechanisms have not yet been tested.”The project has direct practical applications for improving the sustainability of our agricultural system. Perennial grain crops are in the early stages of adoption by agricultural producers and the data collected here can help improve crop performance. “Successful optimization is key to convincing farmers to adopt these more sustainable systems!” concludes Soper.The nutrient footprint of Panama City“By 2050, the human population is projected to increase to more than 9 billion, with 70 per cent living in cities,” says Brian Leung, Associate Professor in the Bieler School of Environment and Department of Biology. “These massive changes will have wide-ranging consequences and will interact with nature’s contribution to people, such as biodiversity and water quality, which are central to planning for sustainable futures.” Yet, in many places on Earth, basic information on urban footprints and their ecological impacts outside city boundaries are lacking, and countries in the Global South are particularly vulnerable.For instance, the Panama Greater Metropolitan Area contains 50 per cent of the country’s population, and is anticipated to increase by a third by 2050. Nutrient pollution will be part of the urban footprint, and will be affected by urban activities. These can include deposition from traffic (transport and road systems are already saturated), peri-urban agriculture (50 per cent of pineapple crops and rice cultivation occur near Panama City), and urban waste water. All of which generate nutrient input into waterways, both reducing water quality to surrounding, environmentally sensitive regions (e.g., Lake Gatun, which provides fresh water for the city), but also providing nutrient subsidies into ecosystems along the Bay of Panama.The Ignite project Estimating the Urban Nutrient Footprint in Panama City and its Ecological Impact, conducted with Associate Professor Kevin Manaugh (Bieler School of Environment and Department of Geography), Assistant Professor Fiona Soper (Bieler School of Environment and Department of Biology) and Associate Professor Graham MacDonald (Department of Geography and Bieler School of Environment Associate) will produce the first estimate of urban nutrient inputs into the environment for Panama City.“We will estimate potential environmental effects, focusing on mangrove ecosystems surrounding Panama City, and develop an urban ‘nutrient’ model, which has not been done for Panama City, and has rarely been done for cities in the Global South,” says Leung. This work will help produce a predictive country-wide model which will serve as a platform to ask sustainability and environmental questions, and provide scientific information needed to make informed policy decisions about the future.The project builds on existing research and programs in Panama, where McGill has long-standing relationships going back 20 years. “These are some of the most important sites for migratory birds in the Americas, with 2.1 million shorebirds flying through every year,” explains Leung. “They are habitat for over 200 resident bird species, provide nurseries for offshore fisheries, carbon sequestration and coastal flood protection, and include a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. Thus, Panama City’s nutrient footprint can have important environmental ramifications.”The project highlights the Bieler School of Environment’s commitment to studying and advancing the resilience of socio-ecological landscapes worldwide, focusing on biodiversity and human interactions with other species, and sustaining healthy societies within a flourishing biosphere.","Sun, 04/03/2022 - 22:37"
McGill aims for new collective agreement with MUNACA,"McGill and MUNACA leadership began negotiations on a new collective agreement in Fall 2020. Since that time, the parties have met more than 50 times. They have since come to agreement on most of the non-monetary elements within the new collective agreement. In January 2022, monetary discussions continued in the presence of a conciliator appointed by the Ministry of Labour.On March 10, 2022, McGill presented its latest offer for a five-year collective agreement informed by a systematic approach to collecting and evaluating salary data. The University compared the pay rates of McGill employees with those of similar positions in other local universities and organizations. The exercise provided the foundation for a new market-based salary structure that is more closely aligned with practices in other organizations. The scale ensures that hourly rates better align with the market median, giving employees the opportunity to reach the market rate much faster than before.In the University’s March 10, 2022, proposal, employees would benefit from an overall average salary increase of over 21 per cent, including an immediate increase of close to 15 per cent, retroactive to 2019. The proposal also includes one-time lump-sum payments to active employees, conditional on McGill and MUNACA reaching an agreement by April 30, 2022.Given current inflationary uncertainty, the University is closely monitoring projected salary increase budgets reported by other major employers.  The proposed annual salary increases, comprised of both automatic step and economic increases, are aligned with the Quebec and Canadian market.Monetary details of the proposal are available on HR’s Labour & Employee Relations website.McGill has successfully reached recent agreements, within similar parameters, with other unions, and therefore believes it is presenting a fair offer to MUNACA while maintaining the University’s financial viability as a para-public institution. Despite this, MUNACA has announced that it will seek a strike mandate from its members at a special general meeting on Wednesday, April 6, 2022.Should the union obtain a strike mandate, the decision to go on strike would fall to the union. A strike mandate would apply to all employees covered by the bargaining unit, including the M1 employees who have recently joined MUNACA.","Fri, 04/01/2022 - 17:00"
Celebrating over 50 years of service to McGill University,"Morty Yalovsky began his career at McGill in 1969, as a sessional lecturer in the Department of MathematicsOwen Egan What is there to say about Professor Morty Yalovsky?“The heart and soul of Desautels,” describes Marianne Vandenbosch, program director of the McGill-HEC Montreal EMBA.“A true community builder,” states Louis Gialloreto, Mini-MBA director at the McGill Executive Institute.“You set an amazing example for everyone in the faculty,” adds Professor Shanling Li.Prof. Yalovsky has touched the lives and hearts of thousands of students, staff and faculty over his 53 years of service to McGill University. On Monday, March 28, over 100 members of the McGill community gathered virtually to pay tribute to his many contributions, and to bestow upon him a Desautels Lifetime Service Award.Prof. Yalovsky began his career at McGill in 1969 as a sessional lecturer in the Department of Mathematics. In 1975, he began his first full-time teaching position as Assistant Professor, Management Sciences at the Faculty of Management. Over the decades, he has served in a number of administrative leadership positions at the Faculty and University level, including as Dean of Continuing Education and several times as Interim Dean of the Desautels Faculty of Management.Helping create a “culture of service”The evening’s celebrations kicked off with some remarks by Dean of the Desautels Faculty of Management, Yolande Chan: “Not only is Morty an experienced and wise administrator, but he leads with humility, kindness, integrity and so clearly, dedication,” she said. “This is what makes a world of difference to so many people who work with him.”Principal Suzanne Fortier shared her own heartfelt words to Prof. Yalovsky. “Morty, this celebration is a great example of what you are so good at,” she said, “bringing people together to build together. You have contributed to building something very important, a culture of service to our University and our community.”Provost Christopher Manfredi chose to share a touching story of how, in 2015, he and Prof. Yalovsky were able to work together to confer the diploma of a young student diagnosed with a terminal illness. “Morty was very tenacious, and we worked together with a lot of different offices at the University,” he said. “We were able to go to the young woman’s hospital room and confer her diploma before unfortunately, she passed away […] I want to thank Morty for his tenacity, his compassion and making that happen.”Lifetime Achievement AwardAngela Campbell, Associate Provost, Equity and Academic Policies, rounded out the words of praise with a special announcement: McGill has created the Professor Morty Yalovsky Lifetime Achievement Award for Excellence in Academic Leadership. “Throughout his service in every role, Morty has worked for the good of McGill. He’s a true trustee who puts the needs, interests and objectives of the University before his own,” said Campbell. “This award is emblematic of McGill’s heartfelt gratitude for Morty’s decades of leadership excellence and contribution from which each of us stands to draw inspiration.”Known for his humility, Prof. Yalovsky took the opportunity to acknowledge the support he’s received.  “None of what we’ve been able to achieve at Desautels would have been possible without support from the University,” he said. “Receiving this award is really truly outstanding, it could not have been done without the help that I have received from everybody.”This Professor Morty Yalovsky Lifetime Achievement Award for Excellence in Academic Leadership will honour the lifetime achievements and dedication to McGill University of academic staff, whose service to the university community has been both exemplary and inspiring. Recipients of the award shall embody the characteristics valued by the McGill community: integrity, wisdom and good judgment, dedication to collegial governance, academic rigour, and institutional commitment.","Fri, 04/01/2022 - 11:46"
Visionary healthcare initiative,"Jobanpreet Dhillon (left) and Dr. Christian El-HadadFor Indigenous people in remote communities, gaining access to healthcare services can be a challenge. In many cases, it means having to take long trips to urban centres, often by plane. Because this is not always a viable option, some people go without proper medical attention for conditions that are easily treatable.To help address these challenges, Dr. Christian El-Hadad, Assistant Professor, Orbital Oncology, Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, has been going to Quebec’s Nunavik region six to eight times a year since 2020. “Together with local leadership support, we were able to redesign eye care in Nunavik, provide telemedicine services and most importantly change the offer of eye care from an itinerant model to a service-based model,” says Dr. El-Hadad.Dr. El-Hadad says his work is a continuation of a decades-old tradition of ophthalmologists serving remote Indigenous communities. It is an initiative that is dear to his heart. “I have always been interested in humanitarian work and global health. I was introduced to Nunavik in a visit with Dr. Susan Lindley in April 2017,” he says. “Later in 2018, I learnt that there was a possibility to be the official ophthalmologist for Nunavik. I saw in this an opportunity to combine my profession with humanitarian work and aboriginal health.”As part of that tradition, Dr. El-Hadad brings with him a medical student to assist with each clinic. In February 2022, Dr. El-Hadad travelled to Puvirnituq, Nunavik, to run a week-long clinic. He was accompanied by Jobanpreet Dhillon, a fourth-year medical student. We spoke to Dhillon about his experience. In the following interview, he discusses the challenges, the rewards and the takeaways from his time in Puvirnituq.Tell us a bit about yourself, what program you’re in and what drew you to it. My name is Jobanpreet Dhillon, and I am a fourth-year medical student at McGill University. Prior to medical studies, I completed an undergraduate in Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences followed by a Master’s in Biomaterials and Stem Cell Therapy at Western University. Although my interest in medicine flourished during undergraduate and graduate studies, I have always wanted to be in a profession where I could create sustainable impact in the health of the people in my community. Through medicine, not only am I able to form long-term meaningful relationships with my patients, but also be an advocate for change to bridge healthcare disparities. McGill Medicine has provided me with an excellent platform to exercise these principles while training to become a future physician.How did you hear about the project in the north?During my clinical elective in ophthalmology at the McGill Academic Eye Centre, I came to know an outstanding physician, surgeon and mentor, Dr. Christian El-Hadad. To learn about his work in organizing ophthalmic care for the Indigenous Peoples in Northern Quebec was both humbling and inspiring. While completing my research elective under Dr. El-Hadad, he was coincidentally scheduled to visit Puvirnituq, Nunavik, for another ophthalmic care assignment. He kindly offered me the opportunity to accompany him and learn about the intricacies of providing healthcare in a resource-limited setting. Needless to say, I jumped on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!What made you want to get involved?It was during my clinical experiences interpreting for the refugee and asylum seeker population when I learned more about the healthcare disparities among certain populations in Montreal. Similarly, during my ophthalmology elective, I had the privilege of serving Indigenous patients in clinics. Hearing stories about their travels, wait times, and other challenges when seeking ophthalmic care, I became motivated to better understand the healthcare barriers that exist for this population. There was no better way to further my learning than immersing myself in the habitat and culture of the people from the remote Indigenous communities in Northern Quebec.What did the day-to-day look like and what did you do?My role was that of a clinical and surgical assist under the supervision of Dr. El-Hadad during this one-week experience in rural Nunavik. Through collaboration with the wonderful nursing team at the Innutsilvik Health Centre, we were able to service a high-volume Inuit patient population of all ages through daily surgeries and in-clinic assessments.Innutsilvik Health Centre – Puvirnituq, Nunavik, QC. Every morning, I would arrive early at the hospital to prepare the operating room and daily clinics in conjunction with the nursing team. During the surgery, I would perform first assist duties with Dr. El-Hadad on specialized procedures such as dacryocystorhinostomies, blepharoplasties, and ectropion and entropion repairs. Additionally, I had the humbling opportunity to close skin incisions on the eyelids of a young Inuit patient. While the surgeries took place, the nursing team would triage the patients arriving for clinic appointments, who were seen in-between surgical procedures and during afternoon clinics. For these patients, I would perform comprehensive ophthalmic assessment, including visual acuity, intraocular pressures, slit-lamp and fundoscopy examination, and then relay my findings to Dr. El-Hadad.The hospital had a small cafeteria with a very welcoming staff and great food options for lunch and dinner. Our living accommodations were comfortably located at a 2-minute walk away from the hospital in a 3-bedroom, 1-washroom unit with complete kitchen and laundry facilities. When the weather wasn’t too cold, Dr. El-Hadad and I were able to explore the small town of Puvirnituq in the evenings.Any particularly memorable or surprising moments? From experiencing the landscape of the remote town along the Hudson Bay to the vibrant culture of the Inuit Peoples, there were many memorable moments during this trip. However, one particular patient encounter certainly remains unforgettable!Minutes before Dr. El-Hadad and I were set to depart for the airport to catch our return flight, a patient who recently underwent a dacryocystorhinostomy crossed paths with us at the hospital entrance in a panic. The wire-like silicone conduit that was keeping the nasolacrimal pathway patent post-surgery had displaced itself, causing it to protrude out of the eyelid. While this was visibly distressing for the patient, it also posed risk for improper healing and other complications. We rushed him to the hospital clinic and attempted to reposition the conduit; however, after multiple attempts, the best option remained to completely remove the conduit.So why was this experience memorable? Well, other than the sprint race to the airport afterwards, this patient encounter perfectly highlights the barriers to ophthalmic care for this remote population. If we had not crossed paths, this patient would have had to wait weeks or months before getting access to a flight and coming down to Montreal to get the appropriate care. In that time, he could have developed infection and possibly compromised his vision in the affected eye. Or equally dangerous, the patient may have resorted to ‘fixing’ the problem himself to avoid the hassle of finding an English-speaking escort, travelling 5+ hours in a cramped airplane to Montreal, and staying in the city for several days away from family.What did you learn through this experience? This trip certainly allowed me to gain a better understanding of the commitment, resilience, and creativity it takes to organize clinical and surgical ophthalmic care suites in a remote setting. From the slow internet speeds that impeded efficiency of clinics to the limited availability of surgical instruments, a physician must be patient and adaptable in such a resource-limited environment. Not to mention, the support from the nursing team, hospital administration, and local counsel is paramount in ensuring the sustainability of such healthcare initiatives.All these efforts cumulate to reducing some of the healthcare accessibility barriers for the Inuit population. Only through such experiences one realizes that the capacity and means to travel hundreds of kilometres to a well-equipped hospital is not equally feasible for all; old age, language barriers, personal responsibilities, and flying to an unknown city can all contribute towards limiting appropriate and timely ophthalmic care. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Inuit People were extremely grateful and appreciative of receiving care in their own community and being able to return their home the end of the day, a privilege that we may take for granted.In the future, I aspire to have a professional career that is inclusive in providing care for underserved populations in Canada. This experience has provided me with valuable insight into the steps and collaborations required to organize clinical and surgical care initiatives in rural settings. And I hope to utilize this knowledge during my residency to implement sustainable programs early in my career that brings awareness, education, and healthcare accessibility to the remote Indigenous communities of the North.Would you recommend the experience to others? Without a doubt, I would recommend this experience my fellow medical student colleagues and residents. They can expect to learn about how the broader determinants of health such as poverty, education, physical environment, social support, healthy behaviours, and accessibility can contribute to the healthcare disparities that exist in remote Northern communities. Furthermore, it presents an incredibly unique opportunity to practice clinical and surgical ophthalmology in a resource-limited environment where one learns to adapt and improvise. Of course, this journey also offers the opportunity and privilege to experience a new culture and gain appreciation for the way of life of the Inuit Peoples.","Thu, 03/31/2022 - 14:04"
Jai Shah named the 2022 SIRS Research Excellence awardee,"Dr. Jai ShahThe Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) has named Dr. Jai Shah as winner of the 2022 SIRS Research Excellence Award. Dr. Shah is an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at McGill, an investigator at the Douglas Research Centre, and Associate Director of the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis.“The Research Excellence Award is given to a mid-career researcher who has shown exceptional research in the field of schizophrenia research and promising research trajectory. Jai Shah fits the bill exactly,” said Dame Til Wykes, SIRS President. “His wide set of interests is shown by his capture of different experiences and methods at Yale, Harvard, University of Toronto, and finally at the London School of Economics where he was a Commonwealth Scholar. His work focusses on the trajectories to psychosis, and their implications for clinical care and service design. This research may have important lessons beyond psychosis by moving from traditional symptom-based conceptualizations of disorders and towards transdiagnostic clinical staging models.”“Jai is remarkable as he connects data-based efforts to lessons for mental health services and systems. This is clearly helped by building a team that includes individuals from disadvantaged groups, first-generation university students, and those with lived experience of mental ill health,” continued Dame Wykes. “Jai is the very best of our young researchers and that was the reason he received the 2018 Future Leaders Award from IEPA and now the Research Excellence Award from SIRS. I am sure he will be receiving many more.”Committed to early intervention effortsAs a psychiatrist and researcher, Dr. Shah is involved in and committed to early intervention efforts, initially in psychosis and now expanding across youth mental health. He has engaged in an array of clinical research projects from neurobiology to health services and policy, focusing on the early phases of psychotic illness, transdiagnostic shifts in early-stage mental health problems, and their implications for the structure and function of services.Dr. Shah’s stellar work has earned the praise of colleagues in the field.“Jai Shah is a rising star in schizophrenia research who has been making important contributions in the leading edge of a number of issues across psychosis and youth mental health, including the relationships between stress, trauma and the biology of risk for psychotic disorders,” said Dr. Matcheri S. Keshavan, Stanley Cobb Professor of Psychiatry at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard Medical School. “He is a committed and creative clinician-scientist, an integrative thinker and a compelling communicator.”Learning from mentors and collaborators “I am incredibly honoured to receive the 2022 SIRS Research Excellence Award. I very much see myself as a clinical researcher, and indeed many of my research group’s investigations have emerged from clinical observations or questions. In that sense, this recognition from SIRS is validation that the two roles of clinician and scientist can co-exist and even thrive together,” said Dr. Shah.“I’ve been extremely fortunate to have worked with and learned from a remarkable set of mentors, collaborators (including youth and family partners), and trainees, each of whom come with diverse backgrounds and approaches. I hope that our work continues to contribute to SIRS’ mission of an integrative vision for early intervention, in which a variety of methods – neurobiology, clinical research, implementation science and more – are applied to serve the principles of flexible, personalized, and low-barrier care, for psychosis specifically and severe mental illness in general.”","Thu, 03/31/2022 - 11:03"
Douglas Research Centre joins The Neuro in Open Science,"La version française suit.Today, the Douglas Research Centre (DRC) joins The Neuro’s Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) as a partner in research data sharing and collaboration through the adoption of a set of institutional Open Science principles.Through this partnership, the DRC commits to publicly releasing research findings and facilitating the use of data for educational, health, and societal impact, all while minimizing the use of restrictive intellectual property protection on research outputs in order to accelerate the rate of medical breakthroughs.Inspired by The Neuro’s Open Science commitment in 2016, this is the second TOSI partnership of its kind—the first being with the University of Calgary’s Hotchkiss Brain Institute in 2021. These partnerships flow from of TOSI’s mission to encourage the adoption of Open Science across Canada. To accomplish this mission TOSI provides guidance and funding to support interested organizations, both of which were key to the DRC’s decision to adopt Open Science.The collaborative effortThe DRC has already taken on a number of Open Science projects. Its Molecular and Cellular Microscopy Platform (MCMP) was the second in Canada to adopt OMERO, software for openly sharing microscopy images. The Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank is in the process aligning its practices with those of the Cellular Biospecimen Imaging and Genetic (C-BIG) Repository, The Neuro’s open sharing platform.In 2019, the DRC launched an in-house Open Science team. One year later, it received $100,000 from TOSI to design a set of institutional Open Science Principles. Now, it’s committed to an Open Science strategy organized into five guiding principles aiming to broadly share research outputs, maximize societal impact, and empower research participants and service users.As a mental health research centre, the DRC will pioneer Open Science research in a challenging area for patient privacy. Mental illness creates unique emotional, social, and cognitive vulnerabilities. Open Science policies must be designed to benefit the research community while respecting the needs of patients and research participants. Overcoming these challenges will create a model for other mental health institutions when implementing Open Science practices.“As the first Canadian mental health research organization to adopt Open Science at the institutional level, we are leading a transformation in our field,” says Dr. Gustavo Turecki, Scientific Director of DRC and Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University. “Many of the Douglas’ research programs have Open Science principles at their core, spanning from extensively sharing brain tissue samples to our far-reaching knowledge translation activities. We expect to show that Open Science in mental health is not only feasible, but most importantly that it enables solid and rapid scientific advances in a research environment integrated to clinical practice.”“Implementing Open Science in mental health research certainly brings challenges, the obvious one being safeguarding the confidentiality of our research participants and service users,” says Professor Sylvia Villeneuve, a researcher at the DRC and Canada Research Chair in early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. “We learned many lessons through openly sharing the PREVENT-AD dataset, a longitudinal cohort of pre-symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease participants that is now findable through the unified interface of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform. We found a balance between implementing appropriate safeguards and being as open as possible. Participants are eager to be part of Open Science studies.”“I’m delighted to see the DRC join Team Open Science,” says Dr. Guy Rouleau, The Neuro’s Director and TOSI co-founder. “It’s exciting to watch the movement spread across Canada, one institution at a time. More and more scientists and administrators are recognizing the value of Open Science, and I encourage more of them to take this step. TOSI is here to help however we can.”–Le Centre de recherche Douglas se joint au Neuro dans la science ouverte Une stratégie en cinq points permettra de maximiser les retombées de la recherche et de maintenir un rôle d’impulsion en matière de recherche et de traitement en santé mentaleAujourd’hui, le Centre de recherche Douglas (CRD) constitue un partenariat avec l’Institut de science ouverte Tanenbaum (ISOT) au Neuro pour partager les données de recherche en adoptant d’un ensemble de principes de la science ouverte à l’échelle de l’établissement.Grâce à ce partenariat, le CRD s’engage à publier ses résultats de recherche et à faciliter l’utilisation des données pour générer des retombées sur l’éducation, la santé et la société tout en limitant la protection restrictive de la propriété intellectuelle sur les résultats de recherche, afin d’accélérer le rythme des découvertes médicales.Inspiré par la démarche du Neuro en faveur de la science ouverte de 2016, il s’agit du deuxième partenariat ISOT de ce type, le premier ayant été conclu avec l’Hotchkiss Brain Institute de l’Université de Calgary en 2021. Ces partenariats cadrent tout à fait dans la mission de l’ISOT qui consiste à faire avancer la cause de la science ouverte partout au Canada. Pour mener à bien cette mission, l’ISOT fournit une orientation et des fonds destinés à soutenir les organisations intéressées, deux éléments essentiels dans la décision du CDR d’adopter la science ouverte.Un effort de collaborationLe CRD n’en est pas à son premier projet en science ouverte. Sa plateforme de microscopie moléculaire et cellulaire (MCMP) a été la deuxième au Canada à adopter OMERO, un logiciel permettant de partager librement les images par microscopie. La Banque de cerveaux Douglas – Bell Canada est en train d’harmoniser ses pratiques sur celles du référentiel de biospécimens cellulaires, d’imagerie et de génétique (C-BIG), la plateforme de partage ouvert du Neuro.En 2019, le CRD a constitué une équipe interne de science ouverte. Un an plus tard, l’ISOT lui a accordé un financement de 100 000 dollars pour mettre au point un ensemble de principes institutionnels pour la science ouverte. Le Douglas s’est maintenant engagé dans une politique de science ouverte structurée selon cinq principes directeurs visant à diffuser largement les résultats de la recherche, à maximiser leurs retombées sociétales et à donner un pouvoir d’agir aux participants de la recherche et aux utilisateurs des services.En tant que centre de recherche en santé mentale, le CRD fait œuvre de précurseur en science ouverte dans un domaine sensible où la vie privée des patients doit être préservée. La maladie mentale crée en effet des vulnérabilités émotionnelles, sociales et cognitives uniques. Les politiques de science ouverte doivent donc bénéficier aux chercheurs, mais aussi respecter les besoins des patients et des participants à la recherche. Le franchissement de ces difficultés permettra de créer un modèle pour d’autres établissements de santé mentale lors de l’adoption des pratiques de science ouverte.« En tant que premier organisme canadien de recherche en santé mentale qui adopte la science ouverte à l’échelle de l’établissement, nous ouvrons la voie dans notre domaine » fait remarquer le Dr Gustavo Turecki, directeur scientifique du CRD et directeur du département de psychiatrie de l’Université McGill. « De nombreux programmes de recherche au Douglas se fondent sur les principes de la science ouverte, depuis le partage intensif d’échantillons de tissus cérébraux jusqu’aux transferts des connaissances de grande portée. Nous voulons ainsi démontrer que la science ouverte en santé mentale est non seulement applicable, mais surtout qu’elle débouche sur des avancées scientifiques rigoureuses et rapides dans un environnement de recherche intégré à la pratique clinique. »« En santé mentale, l’intégration de la science ouverte dans la recherche soulève certainement des problèmes, le plus évident étant la protection de la vie privée des participants à la recherche et des utilisateurs de services », déclare la professeure Sylvia Villeneuve, chercheuse au CRD et titulaire d’une chaire de recherche du Canada en détection précoce de la maladie d’Alzheimer. « Le premier ensemble de données PRÉVENIR-MA mis à disposition sur la Plateforme canadienne de neuroscience ouverte a été pour nous une source d’enseignements. On peut maintenant consulter une cohorte longitudinale de participants atteints de la maladie d’Alzheimer avant l’apparition des symptômes sur l’interface unifiée. Pour ce faire, nous sommes parvenus à un juste équilibre entre la mise en place de mesures de protection adéquates et la plus grande diffusion possible. Les participants souhaitent vivement prendre part à des études de science ouverte ».« Je suis ravi de voir le CRD se joindre à l’équipe de la science ouverte », déclare le Dr Guy Rouleau, directeur du Neuro et cofondateur de l’ISOT. « C’est fascinant de voir le mouvement gagner tout le Canada, un établissement après l’autre. De plus en plus de scientifiques et d’administrateurs prennent conscience de la valeur de la science ouverte, et j’incite le plus grand nombre d’entre eux à franchir le pas. L’ISOT est là pour leur apporter toutes les formes d’aide possibles. »","Thu, 03/31/2022 - 10:06"
CHIME Outrigger telescopes boost search for fast radio bursts,"The new CHIME outrigger telescope being built near Princeton, British Columbia.Jane KaczmarekLa version française suit.In the quest to identify the origins of one of astronomy’s biggest mysteries – fast radio bursts (FRBs) – Canada’s world-renowned telescope, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), is getting backup.Supported by approximately $10 million in grants from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project has now secured funding to complete the construction of three new radio telescopes to work in conjunction with the main CHIME instrument, located in British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley.“It has been a pleasure to work with the talented team developing the outriggers for CHIME,” said Robert Kirshner, Ph.D., Chief Program Officer for Science at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. “Despite the burdens of COVID, interruptions in the supply of steel for the antennas, and competition with bitcoin miners for the specialized computer chips that power their computational wizardry, the CHIME team is headed toward a spectacular improvement in the scientific yield of CHIME’s copious FRB discoveries.”Outriggers to sharpen CHIME’s visionOne of the three CHIME outriggers will be built at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory, California, home of the SETI Institute’s Allen Telescope Array (pictured)SETI Institute With the ability to detect 10-100 times more fast radio bursts than all other telescopes combined, CHIME has had a radical impact on FRB science. The telescope has allowed scientists to observe the vanishingly brief bursts with exquisite time resolution. CHIME’s limitation, however, has been its inability to identify with any precision where the FRBs were coming from. The outriggers will enable this radical leap.“The CHIME telescope can currently locate the position of a fast radio burst to a patch of sky equivalent to the size of the full Moon. With the addition of the three new outrigger telescopes, this patch of sky can be reduced to the size of a quarter held at roughly 40 km,” explained Patrick Boyle, Senior Project Manager for the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project and Senior Academic Associate in the Department of Physics at McGill University.By pinpointing FRBs, the new telescopes will allow scientists to zoom in on the environments within galaxies from which the bursts originate and, in so doing, narrow down the possible explanations for their existence.“The CHIME/Outrigger Fast Radio Burst team is poised to shed even more light on one of the Universe’s most exciting recent discoveries: the fleeting pulses known as fast radio bursts (FRBs),” said lead CHIME/FRB researcher Prof. Victoria Kaspi, Director of the McGill Space Institute and Professor of Physics at McGill University. “The CHIME outrigger telescopes will help us to both understand the origins of FRBs and realize their potential as cosmic probes.”CHIME’s new siblingsThe outrigger telescopes are smaller versions of the original set to be built in three locations across North America. One of the outrigger sites is in Canada:Near Princeton, British Columbia, on land kindly leased to CHIME by HML Mining Ltd., where construction of the new telescope’s reflector has already been completedThe other two are in the United States and result from partnerships with existing radio astronomy observatories:The Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, where it sits in the middle of the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ).The Hat Creek Radio Observatory in California, where the CHIME/FRB project has partnered with the SETI Institute.“Green Bank Observatory’s distance from the other CHIME locations, being within the NRQZ and the pre-existing infrastructure available on our campus make this the perfect site for a new CHIME Outrigger. The instrument will benefit from the protections of radio frequency interference that the NRQZ provides. It is good to see our extensive 2,700 acre campus being used in new ways, and it is exciting to see this impressive instrument under construction,” said Andrew Seymour, a Green Bank Observatory scientist working with the CHIME team on the project.“We are thrilled to welcome the world-class CHIME team to the Hat Creek Radio Observatory,” said Andrew Siemion, Bernard M. Oliver Chair for SETI at the SETI Institute. “Hosting a CHIME outrigger represents a phenomenal and complementary addition to the HCRO’s science mission.”Building on a successful collaborationRepresenting an amazing convergence of scientists across North America, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project is a collaboration between several Canadian and international institutes, including McGill University, the University of British Columbia, the University of Toronto, West Virginia University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Also partnering on the project is the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, the National Research Council of Canada, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the Green Bank Observatory.The outrigger project has also received funding by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the electronics as well as salaries for faculty, postdocs and graduate students located in the United States._____Des télescopes auxiliaires CHIME pour une recherche plus précise des sursauts radio rapidesCes nouveaux instruments localiseront les sursauts détectés par le télescope canadien de renommée mondialeDans sa recherche des origines de l’un des plus grands mystères en astronomie – les sursauts radio rapides – le télescope canadien de renommée mondiale, l’Expérience canadienne de cartographie de l’intensité de l’hydrogène (CHIME), pourra bientôt compter sur des renforts.Grâce à des bourses d’environ dix millions de dollars remises par la Fondation Gordon et Betty Moore, l’équipe du projet CHIME-FRB Outriggers peut aller de l’avant avec la construction des trois nouveaux radiotélescopes qui viendront prêter main-forte au télescope CHIME principal, situé dans la vallée de l’Okanagan, en Colombie-Britannique.« J’ai beaucoup aimé travailler avec cette équipe talentueuse à la conception des télescopes auxiliaires CHIME », déclare Robert Kirshner, docteur en astronomie et responsable du programme scientifique de la Fondation Gordon et Betty Moore. « Malgré les perturbations causées par la COVID, les interruptions dans l’approvisionnement en acier pour les antennes et la concurrence avec les mineurs de cryptomonnaie pour les puces informatiques spécialisées, l’équipe CHIME est sur le point d’améliorer de façon spectaculaire le résultat des recherches de sursauts radio rapides. »Une meilleure vision grâce à des télescopes auxiliairesCapable de détecter entre dix et cent fois plus de sursauts radio rapides que tous les autres télescopes combinés, le télescope CHIME a changé la donne pour l’étude de ces phénomènes. Grâce au télescope, les scientifiques peuvent observer ces sursauts extrêmement brefs avec une résolution temporelle remarquable. Toutefois, CHIME n’arrive pas à déterminer avec exactitude d’où émane les sursauts radio rapides. C’est là que les télescopes auxiliaires entrent en jeu.« Actuellement, le télescope CHIME peut délimiter dans le ciel une zone correspondant à la taille d’une pleine lune. En ajoutant les trois nouveaux télescopes auxiliaires, nous pourrons réduire cette zone à la taille d’une pièce de vingt-cinq cents tenue à une distance d’environ 40 kilomètres », explique Patrick Boyle, chef de projet principal pour le projet CHIME-FRB Outriggers et associé principal aux activités professorales au Département de physique de l’Université McGill.En réduisant la zone de recherche, les nouveaux télescopes permettront aux scientifiques de mieux observer les environnements qui composent les galaxies d’où émanent les sursauts radio rapides et de restreindre les explications possibles quant à l’existence de ces phénomènes.« L’équipe CHIME-FRB Outriggers est bien placée pour lever le voile sur l’un des grands secrets de l’Univers : les impulsions fugaces connues sous le nom de sursauts radio rapides », précise la Pre Victoria Kaspi, chercheuse principale CHIME-FRB de l’Institut spatial de McGill et professeure de physique à l’Université McGill. « Les télescopes auxiliaires CHIME nous aideront à expliquer l’origine des sursauts radio rapides et à utiliser ces phénomènes pour explorer le cosmos. »De nouveaux compagnons pour le télescope CHIMELes télescopes auxiliaires – versions plus petites du télescope original – seront implantés dans trois endroits en Amérique du Nord. L’un des télescopes sera au Canada :aux alentours de Princeton, en Colombie-Britannique, où la construction du réflecteur du nouveau télescope est déjà terminée.Les deux autres télescopes se trouveront aux États-Unis et seront le fruit de partenariats avec des observatoires de radioastronomie :l’Observatoire de Green Banken Virginie-Occidentale, au cœur de la National Radio Quiet Zone (zone nationale de silence radio);l’Observatoire radio de Hat Creek en Californie, où l’équipe du projet CHIME-FRB travaille en partenariat avec l’Institut SETI.« La position par rapport aux autres télescopes, l’installation au cœur de la zone de silence radio et les infrastructures déjà en place sur notre campus font de l’observatoire de Green Bank le lieu tout désigné pour un nouveau télescope auxiliaire CHIME. Dans cette zone, l’instrument sera protégé des interférences radio. C’est intéressant de voir de nouvelles installations sur notre grand campus de 2 700 acres et fascinant d’assister à la construction de ce télescope impressionnant », se réjouit Andrew Seymour, scientifique à l’Observatoire de Green Bank et participant au projet en collaboration avec l’équipe CHIME.« Nous sommes vraiment ravis d’accueillir la brillante équipe CHIME à l’Observatoire radio de Hat Creek », déclare Andrew Siemion, titulaire de la Chaire Bernard M. Oliver pour SETI à l’Institut SETI. « Ce télescope auxiliaire est un complément extraordinaire à la mission scientifique de notre observatoire. »Une collaboration fructueuseFormidable regroupement de scientifiques de partout en Amérique du Nord, le projet CHIME-FRB Outriggers est le fruit d’une collaboration entre plusieurs instituts canadiens et internationaux, notamment l’Université McGill, l’Université de la Colombie-Britannique, l’Université de Toronto, la West Virginia University et le Massachusetts Institute of Technology. L’Institut Périmètre de physique théorique, le Conseil national de recherche Canada, l’Observatoire national de radioastronomie et l’Observatoire de Green Bank participent également au projet.Le projet de télescopes auxiliaires a également obtenu un financement de la Fondation nationale des sciences pour l’acquisition du matériel électronique et les salaires des membres du corps professoral, des chercheurs postdoctoraux et des étudiants aux cycles supérieurs aux États-Unis.","Wed, 03/30/2022 - 14:50"
First Peoples’ House welcomes new Indigenous Student Advisor ,"Marlowe Dubois remembers feeling lost when he moved from his remote Cree community in western Canada to attend university in a big city. In his new role as Indigenous Student Advisor at First Peoples’ House (FPH), helping other Indigenous students make the adjustment to a different culture and a different pace of life is not only his number one priority, but a job he takes to heart. Born and raised in Saskatchewan as a band member of the Ochapowace First Nation, Dubois arrived at McGill in 2016, earning his Bachelor of Education in 2021. First Peoples’ House was an important part of his undergrad experience. “I was very confused by McGill’s very decentralized bureaucracy,” Dubois says, “Making moves to reach out to different services and people is not something I was accustomed to coming from a relatively tight-knit community. With the size of McGill, it can feel as if you’re suddenly in the middle of the ocean when you’re used to a smaller community. The advisors at FPH were very helpful in directing me towards resources and contacts that were useful to me in getting the help and connections I needed at different points during my undergrad. “Making sure other students have that kind of safety net is the most important part of my role.” A ‘home away from home’ Indigenous Student Advisor, Marlowe Dubois A member of McGill Student Services, First Peoples’ House provides First Nations, Inuit and Métis students with a “home away from home,” where they can find support and encouragement to succeed in their studies and remain connected to their culture.  Since taking over the job as Indigenous Student Advisor in February 2022, Dubois has provided Indigenous students with a one-stop shop for key resources to make their lives easier – including strategies on course registration, exam preparation, and applying for financial aid, as well as in-house tutoring, and community and cultural support for students who feel disconnected from their cultures and communities. He has also been busy with planning and logistics work, including putting together a database of resources across Montreal for Indigenous students. Another major part of his title is ensuring Indigenous students are aware of the resources FPH offers –which has been a challenge since the onset of COVID-19.  “Many students are dissuaded when everything we do is entirely virtual, and that face-to-face communication is lost,” Dubois says. “Also, it can be hard to keep up with the different restrictions that are in place, so many students may not know that we are taking drop-in appointments.  “Ultimately, the issue is to just let the Indigenous student body know that we are once again open for students to come visit us, be that to just make use of the space we have available or to take advantage of the different services and events we provide. Cultural activities to return post-pandemic As the pandemic loosens its grip on society – or so it’s hoped – Dubois will work with his colleagues and partners of FPH to plan and coordinate their different events, workshops, and outreach programs – many of which were disrupted or moved online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Included in that list of events is the annual Pow Wow, the organization’s most important event, which usually takes place in mid-September and features multi-tribal groups of dancers and drummers, arts and crafts, and other demonstrations of Indigenous culture. It was last held as an in-person event in 2019. “Obviously, for the past few years, we haven’t had large-scale events, but going forward, we hope to be conducting more events to reach out to students and bring them in,” Dubois says.","Tue, 03/29/2022 - 12:36"
One in four women experience domestic violence before age 50,"Over one in four women (or 27 per cent) experience intimate partner violence before the age of 50, according to a worldwide analysis led by researchers from McGill University and the World Health Organization. The largest of its kind, the analysis covers 366 studies involving more than 2 million women in 161 countries.“Intimate partner violence against women – which includes physical and sexual violence by husbands, boyfriends, and other partners – is highly prevalent globally,” says McGill Professor Mathieu Maheu-Giroux, a Canada Research Chair in Population Health Modeling.According to the findings published in The Lancet, one in seven women (or 13 per cent) experienced intimate partner violence within the last year of the study period between 2000 and 2018. The analysis also found high levels of violence against young women, estimating that 24 per cent of those between the ages of 15 to 19 experienced domestic violence in their lifetime.While the numbers are alarming the true scale of violence is likely even higher, the researchers say, noting that the studies were based on self-reported experiences. Given the stigmatized nature of the issue, women can be hesitant to report their experiences, they explain.High-income countries reported lower rates of domestic violenceThe researchers found regional variations, with high-income countries having lower prevalence of both lifetime and past year violence. The lifetime prevalence among women aged 15 to 49 was highest in Africa, South Asia, and parts of South America. The regions with the lowest estimated lifetime domestic violence against women were Central Asia and Central Europe.The proportion of women who experienced intimate partner violence in the last year was around 5 per cent for North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. In regions of Africa, this number was as high as 15 per cent to 30 per cent.Canada among countries with lowest rates of domestic violence“While Canada is among the top 30 countries with the lowest rates of intimate partner violence, it’s still a problem that affects 1 in 25 women,” notes Maheu-Giroux. “Some provinces in Canada are looking at different ways to address domestic violence. In Quebec, for example, the government approved a pilot project in 2021 to create a special court for victims of domestic and sexual violence,” he adds.Calls to strengthen response in pandemic rebuilding efforts“Overall, our research shows that governments are not on track to meet global targets to eliminate violence against women and girls. An important takeaway is that even in some high-income countries the prevalence of intimate partner violence is relatively high, which calls for investment in prevention at local and global levels,” says Maheu-Giroux.“In Quebec alone, we witnessed a wave of 17 intimate partner feminicides in 2021 – the most extreme consequence of intimate partner violence and the highest number in more than a decade,” he says.Globally, the problem is likely to have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers explain. There’s an urgent need to strengthen the public health response to intimate partner violence, and ensure it’s addressed in post-COVID-19 rebuilding efforts, they conclude.","Sun, 03/27/2022 - 23:56"
McGill’s Secchi scores national swimmer-of-the-year award,"Clement Secchi led all swimmers at the U SPORTS championships winning four gold medals and a pair of silversClement Secchi of McGill was named swimmer of the year at the U SPORTS championships, a three-day meet hosted by Université Laval over the weekend. The 21-year-old management senior from Aix-en-Provence, in France, led all swimmers with four gold medals and a pair of silvers, while breaking three national records and guiding the McGill Redbirds to a third-place finish.The UBC Thunderbirds finished atop the men’s podium, while the Toronto Varsity Blues won the women’s competition for the first time since 2016. Three more records were improved upon on Saturday for nine records set over the weekend in the PEPS pool.“I’m very happy since it was a great battle to the end with Sebastian Paulins (Western) and Blake Tierney (UBC),” said Secchi. “It’s also great to get this award. I was very far from this four years ago so this makes me very happy.”On Thursday, the 5-foot-11 sprinter merited All-Canadian honours after breaking the 100m butterfly national mark with a gold medal time of 50.99 seconds and guided the 4×100 free relay to gold in 3:14.37. Secchi completed the evening with a great effort to anchor McGill’s 4×200 freestyle relay from fourth place to a silver medal (1:44.71).On Day 2 of the meet, Secchi took care of the 50m butterfly, setting a record at 23.23 seconds in the preliminary round, before improving it in the final with a time of 23.05. Secchi later came five-hundredths of a second away from setting another record in the 200m butterfly, dominating the event with a time of 1:54.61 to add a fourth gold medal to his weekend’s total.The Thunderbirds clinched their 19th national title, tying Toronto as the most decorated men’s swimming program in the country. UBC completed all 38 events on the weekend with 1,207 points, way ahead of the Calgary Dinos (917.50) and the McGill Redbirds (757). In the women’s competition, Toronto picked up 1,359.50 points at the conclusion of the 38-event program, comfortably ahead of UBC (1,039), Calgary (888) and McGill (750). This was Toronto’s 16th title in the program’s history.The most decorated individual athlete on the weekend was UBC’s Danielle Hanus, who unsurprisingly won female swimmer of the year award after collecting five gold medals (including the 200m backstroke, and the 4x100m medley relay on Saturday) along with a silver medal.Lethbridge’s Apollo Hess started the day with a new best time of 26.74 seconds in the 50m breaststroke. Later in the evening, the U SPORTS Rookie of the Year winner improved his personal best and a Canadian senior record with a time of 26.65 seconds.In the same event on the women’s side, Manitoba’s Kelsey Wog improved a mark she previously shared with Calgary’s Fiona Doyle (30.70), stopping the watch at 30.45 seconds for a fourth gold medal at these championships.The UBC Thunderbirds improved their own U SPORTS record of 3:32.36 in the men’s 4x100m medley relay going back to 2017. On their last race of the season this weekend, Tayden De Pol, Keir Ogilvie, Justice Migneault and Blake Tierney contributed to the time of 3:29.74.Female Rookie of the Year Emma O’Croinin of UBC won the first event of the evening, the 800m freestyle, touching the wall in 8:33.35. It was Emma’s fourth gold medal at these Championships, to add to her two silver medals.","Sun, 03/27/2022 - 22:53"
McGill wins 14th straight game to capture RSEQ basketball championship,"The 2022 RSEQ men’s basketball champion, McGill RedbirdsMatt GariesSam Jenkins registered a double-double as McGill extended its record win streak to 14 en route to capturing the RSEQ men’s university basketball championship with a 48-46 thriller over Concordia, before a sell-out crowd of 612 at Love Competition Hall, on March 26.It was the lowest-scoring final in Quebec men’s league history, with neither team reaching the 50-point plateau and the lowest points scored by McGill in any victory since the post-war era. The Redbirds punched their ticket to the U SPORTS Final 8 national championship in Edmonton, April 1-3. It will mark McGill’s ninth lifetime appearance at the national tournament (excluding four regional tourneys) and the team’s first since 2018. Their best result was a fourth-place finish in 1977 and 2016.Jenkins, a 23-year-old physical education senior from Hamilton, Ont., scored a game-high 19 points and pulled down 10 rebounds. The 6-foot-3, 192-pound guard shot 7-for-17 from the field, including a 3-for-10 effort from three-point range, and went 2-for-7 at the free-throw line. He added four assists and a steal.If McGill meets Queen’s at the Nationals, the game would feature a matchup of brothers as Scott Jenkins, Sam’s younger brother, is a sophomore guard with the Gaels, who have qualified as OUA silver medalists.The Redbirds jumped into an impressive start, winning the opening quarter by a lopsided 17-5 margin. But Concordia bounced back to win the second period 16-9 as the teams went into the halftime break with a 26-21 advantage for the Redbirds. McGill took the third quarter 13-11 but the Stingers won the final frame 14-9.","Sun, 03/27/2022 - 22:39"
End of vaccine passports and other COVID updates / Fin du passeport vaccinal et autres nouvelles,"Fabrice Labeau | 25 Mar 2022            Campus updates Add to calendarFacebookLinkedInTweet Widget This message is sent on behalf of Christopher Buddle, Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs), and Fabrice Labeau, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), on behalf of the Recovery and Operations Resumption Committee (ROR).Le présent message est envoyé au nom de Christopher Buddle, vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Enseignement et programmes d’études), et de Fabrice Labeau, premier vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Études et vie étudiante), au nom du Comité de la reprise des activités et du retour (RAR).La version française suit.Dear members of the McGill community,With the Omicron BA.2 variant and the lifting of some restrictions, we are seeing a rise in cases in Quebec and many parts of the world, including among members of the McGill community. Governments are rapidly transitioning into a different way of managing the pandemic. The focus is now on preventing serious illness and hospitalisations through vaccination and new treatments for COVID, rather than on restrictions and lockdowns that try to prevent any new cases.The Government of Quebec recently announced that the Paxlovid antiviral medication will be available at all Quebec pharmacies and available to more groups. If you test positive for COVID-19, and are at a higher risk for developing complications, you may be eligible for this treatment.We encourage all students, faculty, and staff to get their boosters as soon as possible by booking an appointment on Clic Santé or by visiting one of the many walk-in vaccination sites across the city. Being vaccinated with three doses provides excellent defense against severe disease. Remember as well that fourth doses are available for certain people who are immunocompromised.As a reminder, if you have tested positive, and have been on campus in the past 48-hours, you must report to McGill’s Case Management Group at 514-398-2920. Do not come to campus if you are not feeling well. Academic and work accommodations are available by filling out the appropriate form in Minerva.Although most COVID measures remain in place at McGill, we are scaling back some of the protocols, in alignment with the changes we are seeing across Quebec and Canada.End of vaccine passports – effective Monday, March 28Although we had planned to continue the vaccine passport system for the remainder of the Winter term, the Quebec verification app is no longer functional. This system has served an important purpose, but it no longer can be effectively implemented.As of Monday, March 28, vaccine passports will no longer be required to access any services at McGill. All other health and safety measures will remain in place.Consolidation of COVID testing sites in residencesAlthough the testing sites in residence saw a bump early this week, overall the number of students coming to be tested can be handled by the main testing site at Carrefour Sherbrooke. Therefore starting April 1, we will be consolidating rapid testing in residences into one site and extending the hours from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.The testing site at Carrefour Sherbrooke will remain open by appointment only for the testing of symptomatic individuals living in McGill’s residences until April 30. If there is increased demand in the future for rapid testing in residences, we will ensure that testing is ramped up to meet capacity.Other quick updates:The full exam schedule is now available. Please confirm the dates, times, and delivery method of your exams here. All exams scheduled in-person, will be delivered in-person. All students must be in Montréal to be able to attend any exams scheduled in-person.If you do not have a RAMQ (Quebec medicare) card, and would like to get a rapid test kit from a local pharmacy, you can book an appointment through Clic Santé by clicking “Choose a service” and selecting “Distribution of free covid screening test.”Administrative and support staff will be on campus at least 60% of their time as of Monday, March 28.Stay safe and have a great weekend.Sincerely,Christopher Buddle	Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs)Fabrice Labeau		Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning)  Chers membres de la communauté mcgilloise,L’arrivée du sous-variant BA.2 d’Omicron et la levée de certaines restrictions entraînent une augmentation des cas au Québec et ailleurs dans le monde, y compris au sein de la communauté mcgilloise. Les gouvernements ont décidé d’adopter une nouvelle méthode de lutte contre la pandémie en comptant sur la vaccination et les nouveaux traitements contre la COVID-19 pour prévenir les formes graves de la maladie et les hospitalisations, plutôt qu’en imposant des restrictions et des confinements pour tenter d’empêcher l’apparition de nouveaux cas.Le gouvernement du Québec a récemment annoncé que l’antiviral Paxlovid serait disponible dans toutes les pharmacies du Québec et accessible à plus de patients. Si vous obtenez un résultat positif à un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 et que vous présentez un risque élevé de complications, vous pourriez recevoir ce traitement.Nous encourageons les étudiants, les membres du corps enseignant et les membres du personnel à obtenir leur dose de rappel dès que possible en prenant rendez-vous sur le site Clic Santé ou en se rendant dans l’un des nombreux sites de vaccination sans rendez-vous à Montréal. Les trois doses de vaccin offrent une excellente protection contre les formes graves de la maladie. De plus, certaines personnes immunodéprimées peuvent recevoir une quatrième dose.Rappel – Si vous avez reçu un résultat de dépistage positif et que vous vous êtes rendu sur le campus au cours des 48 heures précédentes, vous devez communiquer avec le Groupe de gestion des cas de McGill au 514 398-2920. Si vous ne vous sentez pas bien, restez à la maison. Vous pouvez demander des accommodements pour vos cours ou votre travail en remplissant le formulaire que vous trouverez sur Minerva.Nous conservons la plupart des mesures de protection contre la COVID-19 sur nos campus, mais nous assouplissons certains protocoles au vu des changements qui s’opèrent au Québec et au Canada.Fin du passeport vaccinal – le lundi 28 marsNous avions prévu d’exiger le passeport vaccinal jusqu’à la fin de la session d’hiver, mais l’application de vérification du gouvernement du Québec ne fonctionne plus. Ce système a été très utile, mais nous ne pouvons plus l’utiliser efficacement.À compter du lundi 28 mars, le passeport vaccinal ne sera plus exigé nulle part à McGill. Toutes les autres mesures de prévention restent en vigueur.Regroupement des sites de dépistage de la COVID-19 dans les résidencesNous avons assisté à une recrudescence des tests effectués dans les résidences en début de semaine. Cela dit, nous constatons que les tests peuvent être menés au site de dépistage principal situé au Carrefour Sherbrooke. Par conséquent, à compter du 1er avril, le dépistage rapide offert en résidences aura désormais lieu à un seul endroit. Les heures de service seront prolongées et le dépistage sera offert de 10 h à 20 h.Jusqu’au 30 avril, les personnes symptomatiques qui habitent dans les résidences de McGill pourront se rendre au site de dépistage du Carrefour Sherbrooke, sur rendez-vous uniquement. Si la demande pour les dépistages rapides en résidence vient à augmenter, nous nous assurerons que l’offre de service soit revue à la hausse.Nouvelles-éclairL’horaire des examens finaux est disponible. Consultez-le pour connaître les dates et heures de vos examens, ainsi que le mode retenu. Si l’horaire indique un mode présentiel, c’est que l’examen se déroulera sur le campus. Tous les étudiants doivent être à Montréal afin de pouvoir faire leurs examens en présentiel.Si vous n’avez pas de carte d’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) et que vous désirez vous procurer une trousse de dépistage rapide dans une pharmacie, vous pouvez prendre rendez-vous sur le site Clic Santé en cliquant sur « Sélectionnez un service », puis sur « Distribution Trousse dépistage gratuite ».À compter du lundi 28 mars, les membres du personnel administratif et de soutien seront sur le campus au moins 60 % du temps.Soyez prudents et bon week-end à tous.Cordialement,Christopher BuddleVice-principal exécutif adjoint (Enseignement et programmes d’études)Fabrice LabeauPremier vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Études et vie étudiante)","Fri, 03/25/2022 - 11:58"
Meet McGill’s new Accessibility Advisor ,"Catherine Roy, McGill’s Accessibility AdvisorThroughout her life, Catherine Roy has fought for easier access to public spaces, and to raise awareness about the needs of people living with disabilities. Roy, a double tibial amputee and part-time wheelchair user, was appointed McGill’s Accessibility Advisor in July 2021 to advise members of the community on issues relating to disability, accessibility and universal design, and to develop policies and practices that will have a systemic impact. Now part of the Equity Team in the Office of the Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic), she will also be a central figure in drafting the upcoming Strategic Accessibility Plan – a key component of the five-year Strategic EDI (Equity, Diversity & Inclusion) Plan. Launched in 2020, the Plan is aimed at enhancing the representation of underrepresented groups at the University in several key areas, including student experience, research, outreach, workforce and physical space. “As we move forward during Year Two of the implementation of the EDI Plan, we realize there is still much work to be done for accessibility and that a more concerted effort is needed to achieve our goals,” Roy said. “Accessibility and disability are concerns to many stakeholders at McGill, whether students, staff or faculty. Accessibility permeates all activities at the University, whether it be learning, teaching, communicating, recruiting and staffing, or campus management. Bringing all these interests together to help build our vision is a crucial first step in this journey.” A lifetime of advocacy Roy has spent her entire working life advising and advocating for marginalized groups, mainly in the non-profit sector. She has worked with several groups over the years, including the Canadian Human Rights Museum and the Federal Government’s Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Open Government, and developed accessibility standards for the Quebec government’s websites. From 1998 to 2004, she worked as a training and job development advisor with CAMO, a Montreal-based labour agency that  advised the government on issues regarding professional inclusion of people with disabilities, and also managed the federal government’s Opportunities Fund in the province of Quebec. When she arrived at McGill, she was pleasantly surprised at how she was received. “For the last 30 years, I’ve been the accessibility girl,” Roy said. “And when I show up someplace, it’s usually, ‘Oh no, not her. She’s just going to tell us what we’re doing wrong.’ And what I’ve told everybody since I’ve been here is, I’ve rarely encountered such a willingness to listen as I have at McGill.”  Breaking the silence Over the years, Roy has worked not only with those with physical disabilities, but also cognitive disabilities. Among the issues she deals with is the fact many people with disabilities, particularly the less visible ones, choose to remain silent. “From my experience, some people are afraid to disclose disabilities because they’re afraid of how they might be perceived,” she says. “I’ve only been here for nine months, but from what I’ve observed, there really isn’t a culture or community that we can point to with regards to disability. There are all these different groups, but they’re all working separately on their own.” According to the McGill Student Demographic Survey from May 2021, as many as eight per cent of students are living with some form of physical or cognitive disability. Among faculty and staff, the Biennial Report on Employment Equity from May 2021 shows the figures range between 1.7 and 5.2 per cent, depending on the type of employee. Those may be surprising numbers for many, and the surprise may be part of the reason why disability issues are often overshadowed by other issues on campus. “People with disabilities are invisible in our society, for the most part, or they’re constrained to very particular areas, so we don’t see people with disabilities in leadership positions,” Roy says. “We don’t see them in key positions where they can affect change. But that’s why my position was created, because we realized that we really needed to make this a priority. “I think that we have a tendency to look at it as a question of, ‘Are people with disabilities getting the services they need?’ We’ve concentrated a lot of efforts on that, and that’s great. But we probably haven’t put as much effort into including people with disabilities in decision-making roles, where they can advise on policy and practice related to inclusion.” Discussions set to begin March 29 All members of the McGill community are invited to participate in preliminary discussions on the Strategic Accessibility Plan on March 29, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. in the conference room (Room 832) at the Elizabeth Wirth Music Building (527 Sherbrooke St. W.). Roy will be joined by Angela Campbell, Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies), and other members of the Equity Team to listen to community perspectives on accessibility issues, with the goal of kick-starting discussions on what will eventually be contained in the final strategy. The event is only the beginning – those wishing to make their voices heard on accessibility will have more opportunities in the months to come. Updates will be posted on the Equity Website blog. “Thematic consultations will be held over the course of the coming months where the various University stakeholders will be invited to give their opinions and help shape the future of accessibility at McGill,” Roy says. “By the end of the exercise, McGill will have all the necessary elements to start building and implementing a unified vision for accessibility.” People interested in taking part in the March 29 discussion on the Strategic Plan for Accessibility must RSVP before Friday, March 25, end of day.

A major step forward for the New Vic project  ,"A rendition of the New Vic’s exteriorDiamond Schmitt Lemay Michaud ArchitectsLa version française suit.  The ambitious plan to transform a portion of the old Royal Victoria Hospital site into a learning, research and teaching hub took a major step forward on March 22 when the Quebec government released its 2022-23 budget.  Finance Minister Eric Girard announced $787 million will be earmarked for the renovation and expansion of post-secondary educational institutions in the province, which includes funding for the New Vic project.   “Thanks to the government’s support, we are one step closer to our goal of giving a new academic vocation to an iconic site in the city that will benefit Montreal, Quebec and Canada,” said Ram Panda, Chair of the Board of Governors.   “I would like to thank Premier Legault and Ministers Lebel, Girard and McCann for their support of this visionary and structuring project,” said Suzanne Fortier, Principal and Vice-Chancellor. “The McGill community is delighted with this substantial support, which allows this great collective project to continue.”  The University’s plan calls for the complete transformation of what was once the nerve center of the old Royal Victoria Hospital at the corner of Pine Ave. and University St. Once complete, the New Vic will become a mixed-used centre of multidisciplinary education and research that will be anchored by Sustainability Systems (which brings together Molecular–Materials Systems, Earth Systems, and Urban systems) and the Max Bell School of Public Policy.   The renovations and new builds will use sustainable building practices, and create a new green space on the mountain that all Montrealers can enjoy. It will embed Indigenous themes in its public spaces as it balances function with the natural landscape, the site’s heritage, and the recognition that the old Royal Victoria Hospital site has long served as a place of meeting and exchange for Indigenous peoples, including the Haudenosaunee and Anishinabeg nations.   Following the public consultation process required for the project, many Montrealers and civil society groups have indicated their wish that the site remain in the public domain. In this regard, the Quebec government and McGill University intend to promote a form of ownership that will allow the University to occupy the site long-term while keeping its property in the public domain.   _____Le projet Nouveau Vic franchit une nouvelle étape grâce à l’appui du gouvernement du Québec Le plan ambitieux de McGill visant à transformer une partie de l’ancien site de l’Hôpital Royal Victoria reçoit un coup de pouce financier dans le budget 2022-2023 du gouvernement Legault L’ambitieux plan de transformation d’une partie de l’ancien site de l’Hôpital Royal Victoria en pôle d’apprentissage, de recherche et d’enseignement a franchi une étape importante mardi dans le budget 2022-2023 du gouvernement du Québec. Le ministre des Finances, Eric Girard, a annoncé que 787 millions de dollars seront affectés à la rénovation et à l’agrandissement des établissements d’enseignement postsecondaire de la province, ce qui comprend le financement du projet New Vic. L’Université va maintenant de l’avant avec la rédaction du dossier d’affaires, lequel sera soumis à l’attention du gouvernement au cours des prochains mois. Le gouvernement a approuvé le dossier d’opportunité New Vic en mai 2021. « Grâce à l’appui du gouvernement, nous nous rapprochons de notre objectif d’offrir une nouvelle vocation académique à un lieu emblématique de la métropole dont le rayonnement sera bénéfique pour Montréal, le Québec et le Canada », a affirmé Ram Panda, président du Conseil des gouverneurs. « Je tiens à remercier le premier ministre Legault et les ministres Lebel, Girard et McCann pour leur soutien à ce projet visionnaire et structurant », a déclaré Suzanne Fortier, principale et vice-chancelière. « La communauté mcgilloise se réjouit de cet appui conséquent qui permet la poursuite de ce grand projet collectif. » Le plan prévoit la transformation complète de ce qui était autrefois le centre névralgique de l’ancien hôpital Royal Victoria au coin de l’avenue Pine et de la rue University. Une fois terminé, le New Vic deviendra un centre à usage mixte d’enseignement et de recherche multidisciplinaires. qui sera ancré par les systèmes de durabilité (qui regroupent les systèmes de matériaux moléculaires, les systèmes terrestres et les systèmes urbains) et la Max Bell School of Public Policy. Les rénovations et les nouvelles constructions utiliseront des pratiques de construction durables et créeront un nouvel espace vert sur la montagne dont tous les Montréalais pourront profiter. Le design doit assurer l’équilibre entre fonctionnalité, paysage naturel, patrimoine du site et reconnaissance de l’histoire autochtone du territoire. À l’instar de l’Université, l’ancien hôpital est situé sur un territoire qui a longtemps servi de lieu de rencontre et d’échange autochtone, notamment pour les Haudenosaunee et les Anishinabeg. Suivant le processus de consultation publique nécessaire à la réalisation du projet, plusieurs Montréalais et groupes de la société civile ont indiqué leur souhait que le site demeure dans le domaine public. À cet égard, le gouvernement du Québec et l’Université McGill entendent favoriser un mode de propriété qui permettra à l’Université d’occuper le site à long terme tout en gardant sa propriété dans le domaine public. Rappelons que ce projet est assujetti à la Directive sur la gestion des projets majeurs d’infrastructure publique. À cette fin, le dossier d’opportunité du projet Nouveau Vic a été approuvé par le gouvernement du Québec le 26 mai 2021. Le projet suit son cours et est actuellement à l’étape de la rédaction du dossier d’affaires, lequel sera soumis à l’attention du gouvernement au cours des prochains mois.","Thu, 03/24/2022 - 11:18"
Biodiversity and resilience in waterways,"Anthony Ricciardi (left) and Lauren ChapmanThe McGill Bieler School of Environment has announced its first annual round of Spark and Ignite funded research projects. Spark and Ignite are ongoing funding programs designed to help the BSE continue its important work to find interdisciplinary solutions to complex environmental challenges. Among the projects are two that examine changes in aquatic biodiversity and fishing sustainability – from the St. Lawrence River to Lake Nabugabo in Uganda.The Changing St. Lawrence River “The St. Lawrence River has been radically transformed within a span of a few human generations,” says Anthony Ricciardi, Professor of Invasion Ecology & Aquatic Ecosystems in the Bieler School of Environment and Redpath Museum.“Since 1960, following the opening of the seaway, transoceanic ship traffic has become frequent, the watershed has become increasingly urbanized, and climate change has caused water levels to drop and water temperatures to rise.”Research assistant Nicole Moore setting a net to collect fishSunci Avlijas, Ricciardi LabAnother major factor since the 1990s has been a series of species invasions by Eurasian mussels and fishes, linked to subsequent changes to biodiversity. “For example, populations of native mussels – the most imperilled faunal group in North America – have disappeared in many areas following the zebra mussel invasion. Fish communities have been altered, and increasing numbers of invasive fishes are being caught, in place of natives, by commercial fishers, for whom these species have no economic value.”Ricciardi’s Spark project, Drivers of rapid ecological change in the St. Lawrence River, combines his specialization in invasion ecology and aquatic ecosystems, with expertise in experimental community ecology from Andy Gonzalez (Professor in the Department of Biology and Bieler School of Environment Associate) and in multivariate statistical methods from Zofia Taranu (Research Scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada). It will oversee graduate students conducting field work and assembling a database to quantify temporal patterns in the species richness of fish and invertebrate communities within the ~300 km river section from the Lake Ontario outflow to Lac Saint Pierre. The goal will be to relate these patterns to increasing surface water temperatures and points in time in which invasions occurred, thereby producing the first large-scale analysis of changes to biodiversity in the river over time and space.“We expect the data to reveal how fast and to what extent native species have declined, and some of the recent drivers responsible,” notes Ricciardi. “The results should help managers to quantify and prioritize biodiversity threats in the river.” Preliminary results will be used as proof-of-concept in an application for an NSERC Alliance grant to fund a large-scale, multi-site field study that will aim to characterize patterns and drivers of biodiversity change in detail.Resilience in a Ugandan lake Freshwater capture fisheries are fundamental sources of food security in the Global South, particularly in Africa and Asia. “Lake Victoria is the largest tropical lake in the world and Africa’s most important inland fishery,” explains Ismael Vaccaro, an environmental anthropologist and Associate Professor in the Bieler School of Environment and Department of Anthropology. “However, the lake experienced a series of dramatic transformations over the past century including over-fishing and introduction of non-native fishes including the predatory Nile perch. One small native species, Rastrineobola argentea (known locally as mukene) increased in biomass, leading to development of artisanal and commercial fisheries for this species in Lake Victoria and other lakes including Lake Nabugabo: a satellite lake of the larger Victoria and the focus of this study.”Uganda’s Lake NabugaboThe Spark study, Rapidly Changing Socioecological Systems: Lessons from Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, is a collaboration with Lauren Chapman, Professor in the Department of Biology and Bieler School of Environment Associate, and a specialist in aquatic ecology and conservation in Africa. It seeks to understand how Lake Nabugabo, located in Uganda, East Africa, despite being under an enormous amount of human pressure, has proven to be extremely resilient.“Between 2008 and 2019, the mukene fishery in Lake Nabugabo intensified. However, over the same time period there was a dramatic decline in mukene abundance in the lake. Thus, we have a system where a declining resource in the lake is not reflected in a decrease in harvest, most probably due to rapid changes in fisher strategies,” says Chapman.The study, implemented at Chapman’s field site in Uganda, will involve carrying out monthly sampling and interviews with fishers to develop a chronology of their strategies over a decade of rapid changes in fish abundance and public policy, to understand how policies, fishers, and fish species behave and interact with each other, and the impacts on biodiversity and food security.“Lake Nabugabo provides a perfect study case to explore and quantify interactions between fish population dynamics and human users in a very complex but spatially-limited socioecological system,” says Chapman.The research project will combine ecological, economic, and political data to understand why and when fishers pivot to different target species, and why catch rates for some species continue to climb while their abundance in the lakes dramatically declines. The project’s results should be able to provide frameworks for public policies in this field, aligning with the Bieler School of Environment’s mission to understand complex socioecological systems and advance biodiversity study and protection.","Thu, 03/24/2022 - 10:56"
McGill University joins Moderna  in battle against global health threats,"La version française suit.McGill University has joined Moderna’s mRNA Access program, which aims to accelerate innovation and enable new vaccines and medicines for emerging and neglected infectious diseases through collaborative research and preclinical development. McGill is the first university in Canada to join this program as it ramps up its international rollout.“This partnership is a sign of McGill’s strength in core research that changes lives,” said Martha Crago, Vice-Principal, Research & Innovation. “We are an acknowledged leader in mRNA, and joining this platform will help us develop vaccines that will protect human health everywhere on the planet.”“Moderna’s goal is to create a global community of scientists who leverage our mRNA vaccine technology to develop innovative approaches to address emerging and neglected infectious diseases that pose a risk to public health,” said Hamilton Bennett, Senior Director of Vaccine Access and Partnerships, Moderna. “We look forward to working with McGill and our other global partners to prevent future pandemics and help millions of people around the world.”Pathway for effective and safe solutions The on-going Covid-19 pandemic introduced the world to mRNA vaccine technology, which has quickly become a potent tool in the effort to contain this virus. However, mRNA research has the potential to provide effective vaccines for a panoply of illnesses, including emerging and neglected contagions.The mRNA Access program offers researchers an inside track to rapidly prototyping and developing vaccine candidates by enabling institutional partners to use Moderna’s state-of-the-art antigen design capabilities. Promising candidates can be brought to a clinical trial stage more rapidly, offering a chance to shorten the development path and bring effective and safe solutions to the populations that need them.Improving global healthAnne Gatignol, a senior investigator in the Department of Medicine and Microbiology & Immunology at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research is one of the many McGill researchers who will leverage the new platform. The Gatignol lab has identified conserved elements in HIV RNA. Gatignol and her team intend to use Moderna’s mRNA Access platform to design novel HIV vaccine candidates based on HIV structural proteins.“An effective vaccine against HIV remains a major unmet medical need,” said Gatignol. “The mRNA Access platform will allow the McGill community to rapidly develop mRNA vaccines against a wide variety of viral infections affecting low-income countries or the entire world, thereby improving global health.”Treatment for parasitic infectionsAnother avenue enabled by the platform is the development of mRNA medicines against parasitic infections, such as Cryptosporidiosis – of which a major outbreak occurred in the USA in 1993 – or Schistosomiasis, a water-borne pathogen that affects more than 250 million people and threatens almost 1 billion people worldwide. These and other parasites are the focus of Momar Ndao, a Professor in the Department of Medicine and a Principal Investigator of the Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program (MI4), Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.“For example, there is no FDA approved medicine to treat immunocompromised individuals with Cryptosporidiosis,” explained Ndao. “But leveraging the mRNA Access platform offers us a chance to eliminate these diseases and save lives at a global scale, all without adverse effects on the body.”This program provides an opportunity for Canadian researchers and talent to accelerate their research in key areas of public health and infectious disease, including the 15 priority pathogens identified by the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as being persistent global health threats, but also in other research areas._____McGill rejoint la plateforme ARNm de Moderna pour contrer les grandes menaces sanitairesMcGill est la première université canadienne à adhérer à ce programme visant à mettre plus rapidement à la disposition des populations les vaccins et médicaments issus de la technologie de l’ARNm L’Université McGill a rejoint le programme mRNA Access de Moderna. L’objet de ce programme : accélérer l’innovation, par la recherche concertée et les études précliniques, en vue de la découverte de vaccins et de médicaments contre les maladies infectieuses émergentes et négligées. McGill est la première université canadienne à adhérer à ce programme, en voie de déploiement dans le monde entier.« Ce partenariat témoigne du savoir-faire de l’Université McGill en recherche cruciale au service de la vie, souligne Martha Crago, vice-principale (Recherche et innovation). Nous sommes à l’avant-garde dans le domaine de l’ARNm, et l’adhésion à cette plateforme nous permettra de mettre au point des vaccins qui protégeront les populations humaines partout sur la planète. »« Moderna souhaite réunir des scientifiques du monde entier et mettre à leur disposition sa technologie de l’ARNm pour la recherche de solutions novatrices aux maladies infectieuses émergentes et négligées qui menacent la santé publique », explique Hamilton Bennett, directrice principale, Accès aux vaccins et partenariats, chez Moderna. « Nous sommes heureux de faire équipe avec l’Université McGill et nos autres partenaires pour prévenir les pandémies et venir en aide à des millions de personnes dans le monde. »La COVID-19 a fait découvrir au monde entier les vaccins à ARNm, vite devenus de formidables outils de lutte contre la propagation du virus. Or, la recherche sur cette technologie pourrait procurer à l’humanité des vaccins efficaces contre de nombreuses affections, dont des maladies infectieuses émergentes et négligées.En ouvrant à ses partenaires ses installations de pointe pour la conception d’antigènes, Moderna permettra aux chercheurs de concevoir rapidement des prototypes et des vaccins expérimentaux. Ainsi, les candidats prometteurs parviendront plus vite au stade des essais cliniques, et les populations en quête de solutions sûres et efficaces pourront en disposer plus rapidement.Anne Gatignol, chercheuse principale à l’Institut Lady Davis de recherches médicales et professeure au Département de microbiologie et d’immunologie, compte parmi les nombreux scientifiques de McGill qui se prévaudront de cette nouvelle plateforme. Son laboratoire a mis au jour des éléments conservés dans l’ARN du VIH. Son équipe et elle entendent tirer parti de la plateforme de Moderna pour concevoir des vaccins anti-VIH expérimentaux novateurs à partir des protéines de structure du virus.« On attend encore impatiemment l’avènement d’un vaccin efficace contre le VIH, fait observer la Pre Gatignol. Grâce au programme mRNA Access, la communauté mcgilloise pourra mettre au point rapidement des vaccins à ARNm contre des infections virales de toutes sortes qui sévissent dans les pays à faible revenu, voire partout dans le monde, et améliorer ainsi la santé des populations. »Par ailleurs, la plateforme pourra servir à la mise au point d’agents à ARNm contre les infections parasitaires, par exemple la cryptosporidiose – dont les États-Unis ont connu une importante éclosion en 1993 – et la schistosomiase, infection touchant plus de 250 millions de personnes et dont le parasite, transmis par l’eau, menace près d’un milliard de personnes dans le monde. Ces parasites, comme de nombreux autres, font partie des sphères de recherche de Momar Ndao, professeur au Département de médecine et chercheur principal au sein du programme Maladies infectieuses et immunité en santé mondiale (MI4) de l’Institut de recherche du Centre universitaire de santé McGill.« Par exemple, il n’y a aucun médicament homologué par la FDA pour le traitement des personnes immunodéprimées atteintes de cryptosporidiose, explique le Pr Ndao. La plateforme de Moderna nous offre la possibilité d’éliminer ces maladies et de sauver des vies à l’échelle de la planète, tout ça sans effets indésirables sur l’organisme. »Grâce à programme, les chercheurs et les scientifiques de talent du Canada pourront faire progresser leurs travaux dans des sphères de première importance en santé publique et en maladies infectieuses, notamment sur 15 agents pathogènes que l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé et la Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) considèrent comme prioritaires, parce qu’ils font peser sur la planète une menace sanitaire permanente.","Thu, 03/24/2022 - 08:08"
Le bénévolat pour continuer d’apprendre les uns des autres,"Yves Beauchamp, (vice-recteur administration et finance) siège à des conseils d’administration depuis pratiquement le début de sa carrière d’ingénieur et cela continue de faire partie de sa vie. Si on les additionne tous depuis le début jusqu’à maintenant on dépasse la vingtaine, et si on lui demande de définir le bénévolat, la réponse vient rapidement : « Le bénévolat : on s’engage, on apprend, on donne et on retire toujours quelque chose ».Au fil des années, les engagements se sont multipliés, dans tous les domaines, au CA du CEGEP Ahunstic, à celui de l’hôpital Ste Justine, dans les grappes industrielles, les centres de recherches et d’excellence. La liste est longue. L’investissement en temps et en énergie est important, assister aux réunions, écouter, se préparer, bien définir les pistes et les solutions à prendre. Mais pour Yves Beauchamp, «Ça vaut le coup, il n’y a jamais de rencontres inutiles, jamais de réunions inutiles, il y a toujours un lien qu’on établit. »Yves Beauchamp, (vice-recteur administration et finance)Les expériences sont diverses mais avec toujours cet accent sur les échanges. Il y des points tournants, le Cosmodome de Laval par exemple, où la mission sociale est importante, faire la promotion de la science auprès d’un jeune public, pour Yves Beauchamp cela vaut la peine; il y a bien sûr des défis, il faut bien choisir les expositions tout en assurant la rentabilité de l’institution. Bref, une occasion d’apprendre sur des organisations très différentes les unes des autres, avec des missions différentes et apprendre aussi sur les différents types de gouvernance. « On en retire quelque chose, mais on donne également quelque chose. Et quand les gens apprécient ce que nous apportons, cela nous encourage à continuer. »Un emploi du temps de plus en plus chargé a amené Yves Beauchamp à réduire le nombre de CA où il siégeait à titre de bénévole, il en reste trois, l’Académie canadienne du génie – à titre de trésorier, secrétaire, président désigné et président depuis 2014, un engagement qui vise à continuer à valoriser la profession d’ingénieur; InnoCentre –comme administrateur depuis 2013, pour soutenir les jeunes entreprises et l’innovation et le Musée d’archéologie et d’histoire de Montréal Pointe-À-Callière , également comme administrateur et président du comité immobilier depuis 2010, un musée phare à Montréal. Ce sont des engagements qui durent et qui s’inscrivent dans le temps et qui fournissent des expériences très diverses.Que dire à tous ceux et celles qui hésitent à faire du bénévolat?Pour Yves Beauchamp, la réponse vient facilement, « Ça sert à établir des liens, il y aura toujours des occasions de rencontres, d’échanges qui vont nous enrichir au plan personnel. Il faut les saisir. On sort de notre quotidien, de notre travail habituel et cela permet d’avoir une vision beaucoup plus étendue sur ce qui se fait autour de nous, on accompagne les gens dans ces organisations et on est là pour aider, et on se rappelle que l’on fait partie de la société! »","Wed, 03/23/2022 - 16:15"
Volunteering to keep learning from each other,"Yves Beauchamp, Vice Principal (Administration and Finance), has sat on more than twenty boards since the beginning of his career as an engineer. This is how he explains his passion for volunteering: “When you volunteer your time, you help, you learn, you give back to your community and you always get something back yourself.”As the years have gone by, he has racked up opportunities to join the board of institutions in all areas, like Collège Ahuntsic, Sainte-Justine hospital, industrial organizations, and centres of research excellence – to mention but a few. Boards require quite a bit of your time and energy; you have to attend meetings, listen, prepare, identify possible solutions and act on the best among them. But as Beauchamp says, “It’s all worth it. Not a meeting goes by when you don’t build a connection.”“When you volunteer your time, you help, you learn, you give back to your community and you always get something back yourself,” says Yves BeauchampBeauchamp looks back on the many experiences he has had and finds that connection and communication are always key. One of the highlights for him has been his work with the Laval Cosmodome. The Cosmodome has a crucial social mission to bring science to young people, and it can be a challenge to choose the exhibitions while keeping the institution’s bottom line in check. For Beauchamp, sitting on boards is an excellent way to learn about the many different kinds of organizations and missions, and about the many possible governance models. “You walk away with something for yourself, and in return, you give something back. And when people appreciate your contribution, it makes you want to keep going.”Beauchamp is particularly busy these days, so he has had to cut the number of boards he volunteers for down to three: the Canadian Academy of Engineering, an organization that represents engineers and where, since 2014, he has served as treasurer, secretary, president-elect and president; Inno-centre, an organization that supports emerging businesses and innovation and where he has been a member of the board since 2013; and the renowned Pointe-à-Callière museum of history and archaeology in Montreal, where he has been a member of the board of trustees and president of the capital investment committee since 2010. These three positions span a great length of time and expose Yves to a wide range of experiences.What does Beauchamp have to say to people who want to volunteer but might not be ready to take the plunge?Without hesitation, he says, “Volunteering helps you build relationships. You’ll always have conversations that will bring you something of value as a person. You have to seize every opportunity. It’s a way to step out of your own routine and gain a much broader vision of what is happening out there. You support the people in these organizations, and you are there to help them. It’s also a great reminder that you are part of a larger community!”","Wed, 03/23/2022 - 16:02"
RI-MUHC team receives Discovery of the Year Award from Québec Science magazine,"Members of the Lebrun Lab (left to right): Girija Daliah, Research assistant; Gang Yan, PhD student; Sophie Poulet, PhD student; Julien Boudreault, PhD student; Meiou Dai, Research Associate and first author of the study; Yi-Ching Tsai, MSc student; Ni Wang, Research Associate; and Jean-Jacques Lebrun, principal investigator of the studyQuébec Science magazine has a long-standing tradition. Each fall for 29 years now, a jury of scientists and journalists selects the 10 most remarkable Québec discoveries of the past year, and invites the public to vote for its favourite.As announced by Québec Science earlier this week, the 2021 Discovery of the Year went to the work of Jean-Jacques Lebrun and his team to unveil of the genetic mechanisms at work in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer and the discovery of a promising targeted combination therapy.Each day, 75 Canadian women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 15 die from it. While there is no targeted treatment for triple-negative breast cancer, this could change thanks to the efforts of Lebrun, PhD, and Senior Scientist in the Cancer Research Program at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC), and his team.Highly aggressive form of breast cancerWhat if we started from the beginning? That’s the question Lebrun had in mind in tackling triple-negative breast cancer, one of the most aggressive forms of the disease. While it accounts for about 15 per cent of cases, it causes half of all deaths. “Currently the only treatments are chemotherapy and radiation, and they don’t work well. The risk of metastasis and of recurrence is high,” explains Lebrun, who is also a Professor of Medicine at McGill.To uncover the Achilles heel of this cancer, Lebrun’s team combed through tumours’ entire genome to detect which genes play a predominant role in the tumour process. Growing cancer cells from triple-negative breast cancer patients and using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, a sort of “genetic scissors,” the team proceeded to “turn off” each of the 20,000 genes one by one. The cancer cells were then transplanted into the mammary glands of mice. As the cells multiplied, the investigators were able to determine the ability of each gene to slow or halt tumour development.The team identified two major signalling pathways, or “networks” of genes that modify cell behaviour. One of them, the mTOR pathway, is known to be deregulated in several cancers and to promote abnormal proliferation. The other, the Hippo pathway, is rather protective: in normal circumstances, it safeguards cells from tumour progression.“Tangible hope”The scientists then tested drugs that could potentially target these pathways. They found two that were effective: torin 1, a second-generation drug known to block the mTOR pathway, and verteporfin, a drug generally used for retinal disease that can activate the Hippo pathway. After testing them on cancer cells from hundreds of patients with different subtypes of triple-negative cancers, the scientists found that the drugs’ effect was greater when they were administered together than their individual effects combined, and that they succeeded in eradicating the tumour.These results, which have been published in Nature Communications, are the result of five years of work. The next step is to set up clinical trials, a task Lebrun is now undertaking.“Cancer affects each of us in one way or another. The interest our readers take in advances in the field of oncology is noticeable each year. This discovery is especially encouraging because it comes with a tangible hope of treatment,” says Marine Corniou, associate editor-in-chief of Québec Science.Concrete solution “It’s an honour to win this award with a discovery in basic research. To date, very few studies have used genome-wide, in-vivo CRISPR genetic screening as we did,” says Lebrun. “Our study highlights how powerful and robust this technology is to develop innovative and clinically relevant therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment. We know that many drugs fail in the clinical phase, but I’m optimistic because we started from the mechanism to develop a concrete solution.”“On behalf of the entire community of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, I wish to congratulate Dr. Lebrun and his team on this hopeful discovery. We are proud to provide researchers like Dr. Lebrun with an environment that combines biomedical research and clinical medicine. As the largest hospital-based research institute in Quebec, the RI-MUHC accelerates the translation of basic discoveries into public health, thereby contributing to improving the health of children and adults throughout their lives,” says Dr. Rhian Touyz, Executive Director and Chief Scientific Officer of the RI-MUHC.","Wed, 03/23/2022 - 15:19"
Vive le français!,"Photo: Owen EganAlors que nous profitons des premières journées printanières, qui coïncident avec la Journée internationale de la Francophonie, la communauté mcgilloise est conviée à prendre part à la 6e édition de la Francofête à McGill. Cette célébration annuelle est un superbe exemple de l’engagement continu de McGill envers la culture québécoise et la langue française. Je suis ravie de voir le retour de tant d’activités de la Francofête en personne sur notre campus cette année. Il reste encore toute une semaine de programmation innovatrice et stimulante à venir, et j’encourage tout le monde à participer à cette belle initiative.Bien sûr, la Francofête à McGill n’est qu’une des nombreuses initiatives mises de l’avant au fil des ans pour soutenir et promouvoir le français et la culture québécoise à l’Université McGill : le portail Vivre McGill en français, le bulletin McGill dans la ville, et le Comité de promotion du français, pour n’en nommer que quelques-unes.Aujourd’hui le français occupe une place de choix au sein de la collectivité mcgilloise : près de 60 % de nos 40 000 étudiants – qui sont issus de plus de 150 pays – ont une connaissance du français. Par ailleurs, la majorité des employés parlent le français et plus de la moitié des membres de la haute direction de l’Université sont francophones et tous peuvent s’exprimer en français.McGill continue de fêter 200 ans d’histoire – deux siècles d’enracinement et de contribution au développement de Montréal, du Québec et du Canada, plus grande ville et plus grande société francophones d’Amérique du Nord. Cet ancrage unique a façonné l’évolution de notre institution et l’engagement en faveur de la langue française est une grande source de fierté pour moi et pour toute notre communauté universitaire.","Tue, 03/22/2022 - 12:42"
Martha Crago Awarded the German Order of Merit,"Martha Crago (left) receives the Knight’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany from Sabine Sparwasswer, Germany’s Ambassador to CanadaOwen Egan Earlier today, Martha Crago, Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation, was presented with the Knight’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. The award was handed over by Germany’s Ambassador to Canada, Ms. Sabine Sparwasser, at a special ceremony at McGill. The Order of Merit is awarded to Germans as well as foreigners for outstanding achievements in the political, economic, social, or intellectual realms.“Striving for excellence, extending the frontiers of knowledge and investing into research – these are the factors that will enable our nations to be successful and free in the next century,” said Ambassador Sabine Sparwasser. “We honour those who promote science and research. Martha Crago has shown extraordinary dedication to fostering cutting edge Canadian-German science and research relations during her long and outstanding career. She played a key role in advancing flagship projects for the bilateral research collaboration. Among these projects are the Helmholtz International BigBrain Analytics and Learning Laboratory, an undertaking of Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives at McGill University, Helmholtz International, Forschungszentrum Jülich (FJZ), and Mila, which is mapping the human brain by using technologies such as artificial intelligence.”Personal and professional connections to GermanyCrago (née Borgmann) has a close relationship to Germany, stemming from long-standing professional and family connections. At McGill, she has facilitated several research partnerships between Canada and Germany. Under her leadership, McGill, and its affiliate the Douglas Research Centre, have formed an international partnership with the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry. This collaborative initiative is the first international effort devoted to understanding the relational biology of early-life adversity and psychiatric disorders.As the Vice-President (Research) at Dalhousie University, Crago spearheaded a MOU between the Helmholtz Institute of Marine Sciences (IFM-GEOMAR), formerly known as Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences, in Kiel, Germany, and the Halifax Marine Research Institute (HMRI). She hosted a visit by Chancellor Merkel to the University to celebrate the partnership.In 2015, when families fled from war torn Syria and found refuge in Germany and Canada, Crago was influential in establishing funded partnerships between Canadian and German child development researchers and refugee and immigration scholars.“Life-defining moments”Crago was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 2017 and awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of British Columbia in 2020. In 2009, she was made a Chevalier de l’Ordre des Palmes Academiques by the French government. She was named a Woman of Excellence by the government of Nova Scotia in 2015 and Femme de Mérite de Montréal in 2000. She is also the recipient of a McGill University Prize for her contributions to research.“I am deeply touched to receive the Knights Cross,” said Crago. “My connection to Germany has been woven throughout my life, decade by decade, from childhood summers spent with my German Canadian grandmother to my work connecting excellent Canadian researchers with outstanding German counterparts. I was in Berlin in August 1961 the day the Berlin Wall went up and I was also there on November 9, 1989, the day it fell. These life-defining moments continue to inspire me in the pursuit of ideas that transcend boundaries.”","Tue, 03/22/2022 - 10:05"
"Amid war and disease, World Happiness Report shows bright spot","In this troubled time of war and pandemic, the World Happiness Report 2022 shows a bright light in dark times. According to the team of international researchers, including McGill University Professor Christopher Barrington-Leigh, the pandemic brought not only pain and suffering but also an increase in social support and benevolence.As the world battles the ills of disease and war, it is especially important to remember the universal desire for happiness and the capacity of individuals to rally to each other’s support in times of great need, say the authors of the report. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the World Happiness Report, which uses global survey data to report on how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries around the world reaching over 9 million people in 2021.“COVID-19 is the biggest health crisis we’ve seen in more than a century,” says Professor John Helliwell of the University of British Columbia. “Now that we have two years of evidence, we are able to assess not just the importance of benevolence and trust, but to see how they have contributed to well-being during the pandemic.”Growth in acts of kindnessHelliwell adds “We found during 2021 remarkable worldwide growth in all three acts of kindness monitored in the Gallup World Poll. Helping strangers, volunteering, and donations in 2021 were strongly up in every part of the world, reaching levels almost 25 per cent above their pre-pandemic prevalence. This surge of benevolence, which was especially great for the helping of strangers, provides powerful evidence that people respond to help others in need, creating in the process more happiness for the beneficiaries, good examples for others to follow, and better lives for themselves.”Finland takes the top spot while Canada drops to 15th placeFor the fifth year in a row Finland takes the top spot as the happiest in the world. This year its score was significantly ahead of other countries in the top ten. Denmark continues to occupy second place, with Iceland up from 4th place last year to 3rd this year. Switzerland is 4th, followed by the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The top ten are rounded out by Sweden, Norway, Israel and New Zealand. The next five are Austria, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Canada, in that order. This marks a substantial fall for Canada, which was 5th ten years ago.“The downward trend for Canada is significant and has been going on steadily for years. While Canada once ranked beside the Scandinavian countries, it now ranks closer to the United States in people’s overall evaluation of how good their lives felt,” says Professor Christopher Barrington-Leigh of McGill University.The rest of the top 20 include the United States at 16th (up from 19th last year), the UK and the Czechia still in 17th and 18th, followed by Belgium at 19th and France at 20th, its highest ranking yet. Overall, the three biggest gains were in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania. The biggest losses were in Lebanon, Venezuela, and Afghanistan.FinlandDenmarkIcelandSwitzerlandNetherlandsLuxembourgSwedenNorwayIsraelNew ZealandAustriaAustraliaIrelandGermanyCanadaConflict in Afghanistan takes a tollJan-Emmanuel De Neve, the Director of the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford notes that “At the very bottom of the ranking we find societies that suffer from conflict and extreme poverty, notably we find that people in Afghanistan evaluate the quality of their own lives as merely 2.4 out of 10. This presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims and the fundamental importance of peace and stability for human wellbeing.”Progress marked by measures of happiness“The World Happiness Report is changing the conversation about progress and wellbeing. It provides important snapshots of how people around the world feel about the overall quality of their lives,” says McGill University Professor Christopher Barrington-Leigh. According to the researchers, this information can in turn help countries to craft policies aimed at achieving happier societies.Past reports have looked at the links between people’s trust in government and institutions with happiness. The findings demonstrate that communities with high levels of trust are happier and more resilient in the face of a wide range of crises.Read the World Happiness Report 2022Watch the brief introduction of the World Happiness Report by Christopher Barrington-Leigh","Tue, 03/22/2022 - 08:06"
The importance of clean and affordable energy,"Natalie Wu, a Bioresource Master’s student, was a Junior Professional Consultant for the World Food Programme in RomeThrough the International Youth Internship Program (IYIP), a joint program with the Government of Canada and the United Nations Association in Canada, young Canadians are given the opportunity to gain professional experience in international development work. Natalie Wu, a Bioresource Masters student, was selected to take part of the 2021 cohort. She was a Junior Professional Consultant (JPC) and was remotely placed for six months at the World Food Programme’s (WFP) headquarters in Rome. Within WFP, Natalie was part of the Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction Programme Units’ Energy for Food Security Team. This team aims to integrate climate and energy solutions across a range of programmatic areas including school feeding, smallholder farmer support and nutrition. As a JPC, Wu supported the Energy for Food Security Team with research communication, knowledge sharing and project implementation. She worked on a range of projects including designing nutrition research methodology, reporting on 2020 energy results, creating country energy profiles, as well as, writing brochures about current WFP projects and their impacts on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). Through this experience, she learned the importance of sharing knowledge of SDG 7.Wu has prepared the following article.Sustainable Development Goal 7Over the past decade, access to electricity has expanded, the use of renewable energy has increased, and the energy efficiency has improved. However, there are still 759 million people worldwide who lack access to electricity. SDG 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. There are five specific targets that need to be met by 2030 including increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, enhancing access to clean energy research and technology, and expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries. Clean and affordable energy is an engine of transformative socioeconomic opportunities that touches on all aspects of sustainable development as it is essential in achieving two-thirds of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Enhancing food security with improved energy accessEnergy access is a fundamental enabler to achieving food security and zero hunger (SDG 2) as energy is not only necessary to consume food but is essential for every stage of the food system including food production, processing, transportation, preservation, and consumption.In food production, having access to energy increases efficiency and crop yields. Energy powers equipment that enables efficient land clearing, preparation, and harvesting. Water pumps allow irrigation and water distribution while bio-digestion systems transform organic waste into gas energy and soil-fertilizing sludge. After food production, food processing such as milling, grinding, de-husking, and pressing heavily benefits from energy access. Energy powered storage and handling technology such as refrigerators, drying, pasteurization and packaging machines can help reduce post-harvest food loss and improve food quality. These energy power technologies enable farmers to control the timing of crop sales and enables food to reach the markets and consumers. Thus, improving household income and increasing the availability of nutritious foods.Impacts of clean cooking According to the 2020 Tracking Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7: The Energy Progress Report, globally 2.8 billion people do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Food consumption is negatively affected by the lack of energy in multiple ways. Being unable to properly cook food or disinfect water by boiling increases people’s chances of contracting a food borne illness. High prices and energy scarcity force any people who struggle to secure cooking fuel to adopt coping strategies that have negative impacts on nutrition such as bartering food rations for fuel, purchasing less food or less nutritious food or skipping/undercooking meals.Bangladesh, Cox’s Bazar 2021WFP/Mehedi RahmanMany are forced to rely on inefficient cooking technologies and fuels however, emissions from these can cause respiratory diseases. It is estimated that 4 million deaths each year are linked to air pollution from cooking. When the energy cooking needs of displaced people are ignored, it often results in tensions with host communities over biomass resources such as firewood which can be used as cooking fuel. As well, collecting these resources exposes people (disproportionally women and children) to harassment and violence.Not only does have inefficient cooking impact people’s health but the health of the environment. Collecting firewood for cooking fuel contributes to deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. While the use of open fires and inefficient stoves emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.The reduction of these negative impacts of inefficient cooking can be achieved lowering or eliminating the need of harmful fuels through improved cookstoves or modern cookstoves. Improved cookstoves are those that use solid or sometimes liquid fuel to deliver higher efficiency cooking than traditional cooking methods such as three stone fire. While modern cookstoves are those that have very low levels of polluting emissions utilize fuels such as liquid petroleum gas, ethanol, biogas, or electricity very efficiently.The shift to more efficient cooking technologies includes a variety of options to best suit the population. In rural locations, efficient biomass stoves are suitable if there is no access to electric girds or viable way to get fuels such as LPG to the community. While electric pressure cookers are a great option when electricity is available either on-grid, from mini-grids, or stand-alone photovoltaic systems. As of 2019, 90 per cent of the global population is connected to electricity, meaning electric cooking is becoming a realistic option for many.Despite significant progress over the past decade, only 66 per cent of the global population has access to clean cooking technologies and fuels. There are still many people worldwide who are reliant on polluting fuels as technologies. With the work of agencies such as WFP and UNA-C, conducive environment for clean and modern cooking solutions can be adopted in all communities around the globe.Malawi 2020WFP/Margaret Mkandawire","Mon, 03/21/2022 - 23:00"
McGill initiatives to support Ukraine,"Updated: May 5, 2022 An estimated three million Ukrainian refugees have crossed into neighbouring countries in recent weeks, and more than 6,100 Ukrainians have already arrived in Canada.

"Getting the word out, en français","(l to r): McGill researchers Jason Opal, Kirsten Crandall and Andrew Gonzalez One of the essential, though sometimes under-appreciated, tasks for researchers is to disseminate their work and expertise to a larger audience – whether it be through traditional or social media. In Quebec, the ability to communicate in both official languages only broadens that potential audience.Speaking French also enhances collaboration – especially outside of Montreal – by opening the doors to numerous professional opportunities.Kirsten Crandall, Andrew Gonzalez and Jason Opal are three McGill researchers who are using French to enhance and disseminate their work. All three are anglophones who took very different paths in learning to speak French. But today, all three are reaping the benefits of being bilingual.Andrew Gonzalez: Biologist adapts to new environmentsBorn in London, Andrew Gonzalez grew up in Kent, in the southeast of England. “It is a beautiful part of the world that is often called the Garden of England,” says Gonzalez, the Liber Ero Chair in Conservation Biology. “It was a perfect environment for a budding biologist.”On top of benefitting from Kent’s fertile landscape, Gonzalez also profited from a home life that was equally stimulating.“Almost everyone in my family is a language teacher. So, everyone speaks three languages or more,” he says. “My father is Spanish and my mother is English. When they met their common language was French, so I grew up hearing my parents speaking French to each other at home, even though they spoke English to me. As a child, that home environment trained my ear for French and gave me a head start at school.”Immersive experienceAfter earning his PhD at Imperial College in London, Gonzalez took a teaching position at the University of Paris VI. Calling it a “severe test” of his French, Gonzalez had to prepare lectures in ecology and evolution to undergraduates.“I plunged into learning the technical and scientific terms of my field and learned to prepare good presentations in French. Those first lectures were terrifying because nothing prepares you for that experience,” he says. “It was a steep learning curve but within a few months, I had enormously enriched my understanding of French, the skills required to teach science in French, and how to communicate well with the students who also wanted an approachable professor.”Commentator on issues of biodiversityGonzalez came to McGill in 2003. As with any move of that scope, there were adaptations to be made. Nineteen years later, the process is still ongoing.“When I moved to Quebec, I had to quickly adapt my French; that meant adapting my ear to an unfamiliar Quebec accent, and sometimes a new vocabulary, when working with representatives of the ministries of the Quebec government, town mayors, or when working with conservation NGOs and other organizations wanting to work with me as a biodiversity scientist,” he says. “I am still learning to do this well. I would say that I still miss references that are associated with common idioms or sayings.”Gonzalez is regularly called upon to comment on news related to the biodiversity crisis. “During my time at McGill, I have had the opportunities to speak about science on French radio (RDI) or TV or speak to journalists writing for French-language newspapers, such as Le Devoir or La Presse,” he says. “Here the challenge is to speak in plain terms and remove the technical jargon that can sometimes get in the way of the fascinating, or terrifying, discovery that the research has revealed.”Most recently, on March 3, L’actualité published an interview with Gonzalez on the challenges of protecting biodiversity.Use it or lose itGonzalez says the key for anyone looking to learn French, or any language, is to use it regularly and in as many different contexts as possible.“I liked to listen to the radio, or watch my favorite movies in French. Finding a willing francophone friend to force you out of your comfort zone, both with your spoken and written French also helps,” he says. “At one point, I translated several chapters of Darwin’s On the Origin of the Species from French back to English, to expose myself to the challenge of translation. Learning this way can be hard, and progress can feel slow. But, I found that my learning proceeded in jumps, both in ability and confidence. In the end, it was the diversity of learning experiences and communication opportunities that transformed my ability to work in French.”Kirsten Crandall: Bilingualism enhances opportunitiesThe field of biology is challenging enough without having to learn scientific terms in another language. But for PhD student Kirsten Crandall, the extra effort to learn to speak the language of a biologist in French is not just a luxury, but a necessity.“A lot of my research happens outside of the island of Montreal, and as you go further away from the island, you begin to realize there aren’t as many anglophones,” Crandall said. “If I remained on the island of Montreal and I only spoke one language, my opportunities would be far more limited.”Early exposure to FrenchCrandall – a joint PhD candidate in Biology at McGill and at the University of Ottawa – grew up in an English-speaking household on Montreal’s mostly anglophone West Island, as well as the mostly francophone suburb of Vaudreuil-Dorion. Crandall was functionally bilingual since her preschool days, having had the opportunity to take many of her elementary, high school and CEGEP classes in French.“I went to a private school which focused on doing specifically a 50/50 day of French and English,” Crandall said. “From kindergarten to grade six, it was 50 per cent English, 50 per cent French, and then afterwards, you pick the extent of how much French you’d like to keep in your curriculum.”While she did bachelor’s and master’s studies at McGill, her course work was mainly done in English, though when she became a PhD student, she began working with French-speaking environmental groups and private companies.“I was working with a lot of people who spoke only French, or who were bilingual and preferred to be spoken to a written in French, and so that’s sort of where it came back into my research at my work,” Crandall said.Opening doorsAt that time, she also understood the importance of becoming more comfortable with talking biology in French.“Most of the places that I would look for in a future career are going to be in a mainly French domain,” she said. “I saw that it would be very beneficial for me to start learning all the French terms, and also just being a lot more comfortable with describing my research in both languages.”Using French on a daily basis, both at home and at work, has not only helped her build confidence, but has opened doors that would otherwise be closed to her.“If I wanted a government job within Quebec, but I didn’t know French, I wouldn’t be able to have that job because it’s a requirement,” Crandall said. “Same thing for the Canadian government. You have to be bilingual. I knew that if I was most likely going to be staying here long term, which is probably the case, that if I want to make sure I have as many opportunities as possible, I definitely should pursue strengthening my French in order to make sure it’s the best it can possibly be.”Jason Opal: All inUnlike either Gonzalez or Crandall, Jason Opal learned French relatively late in life. In 2009, Opalwas living in Maine with his wife when he was hired by McGill. He started taking French lessons right away.“I was coming to McGill with tenure, and my wife was pregnant with our first child, who I knew would be going to school in French. It seemed to me essential to learn French for the long-term – just for living. I didn’t think of it in terms of scholarship, I thought of it in terms of my kid’s school, speaking to my neighbours, getting the car fixed kind of thing,” says Opal, an associate professor in the Department of History. “For me my initial motivation was family oriented and it grew outward. I didn’t want to be isolated here. I know you can do it, but I wanted to be comfortable where I lived.”“I was 33 or 34 at the time and I had grown up as an army brat (my father was a doctor in the army) in the U.S. where a second language is pretty perfunctory. Learning French was a major challenge.”In the classroom as a teacher and a studentArriving in Montreal in 2009, Opal redoubled his efforts. On top of his duties as a new professor, he took French classes at McGill, hired a tutor, and studied at least an hour every night. “I was all in,” he recalls. “I listened to French music while reading the lyrics and I annoyed my colleagues to write emails in French. I did everything I could.”Slowly, the hard work began to pay off. Within two years, Opal was asked to be on a dissertation committee where all the meetings were in French. “I was over my head for another year after that,” he says. “But that’s how you learn, right? You have to be just a little bit under water.”The real turning point came in 2014, when Opal, his wife and his two children spent the summer in Paris while their home underwent renovations.“In Montreal, you are surrounded by French, but in Paris you are immersed. But by the end of our stay I was [no longer self-conscious about making grammatical errors],” he says. “I think it is tough for academics. We don’t want to make mistakes. But the point is, you have to communicate. You don’t have to be Molière, you just have to communicate well – and people really appreciate the effort.”“A million ways French has enhanced our life here”Not only do francophones appreciate Opal’s efforts, they seek out his expertise. In particular, during the last U.S. election, Opal was a frequent media commentator – including on French TV and radio.As well, it has enhanced his outreach activities. Until the onset of the pandemic, Opal spoke regularly at a francophone CEGEP. Discussing his research in what he calls “my schoolboy French,” Opal says “it opened McGill as a possibility to francophone students. Some of them would email me afterward asking about application process.”But the biggest payoff to learning French has been at home. “There are a million ways it has enhanced our life here. But, the most dramatic is with our kids,” he says. “Both our children are going to school in French and it has been a real confidence boost for them. It has been such a great opportunity for us to be bilingual. It is hard to imagine our lives if we didn’t speak French.”","Thu, 03/17/2022 - 15:35"
Patient-participants: A driving force in clinical research,"Dr. Angela Genge, a neurologist and executive director of the CRU, examines a patient taking part in a clinical trial at The NeuroTony Revoy/The NeuroThis week is Brain Awareness Week, an international initiative to increase public awareness about neuroscience research which seeks to better understand and treat conditions like ALS, Alzheimer’s Disease, stroke and migraine. The American Brain Foundation estimates that there are 600 neurological diseases affecting one in six people worldwide.Every new medication that makes it onto a prescription pad at your doctor’s office had to go through a clinical trial first to assess its safety and efficacy. Yet, there is one essential element in the clinical trial process that goes unmentioned when discussing advances in research – and that’s the patients themselves. Without their participation, progress in treating neurological diseases would come to a halt.Partners in the process Neurological conditions have a heavy burden of disease, and many conditions are degenerative. Individuals living with these diagnoses may have a strong motivation to help test novel treatments.  “I very much believe in the work that researchers do. It contributes to our own hope as patients,” explains Ana [Editor’s note: to protect the privacy of patients, pseudonyms have been used] who was diagnosed over 15 years ago with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS), when she was 24.Ana was prescribed medication that allowed her to remain active, practicing karate, tennis and hiking for several years, until her MS progressed. At that point, her neurologist at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) proposed that she take part in a clinical trial testing a new medication. “I felt I had to do something. This is an illness that affects a lot of young people and taking part in a trial seemed like a good way to help further science.”Thanks to patients, the treatment landscape has changed considerably in the past decade. “There are more approved treatments for neurological diseases than ever before,” asserts Dr. Angela Genge, the executive director of the Clinical Research Unit at The Neuro (CRU), one of the largest neurological research centres in Canada, conducting over 115 clinical trials each year. “We are studying investigational treatments that would be the first approved therapies for a number of rare diseases. And we are also studying ways to lessen the burden of disease for patients, for example with new oral formulations for therapies that were previously given by IV infusion.” At the heart of clinical researchPatients are essential partners at the CRU. “We are grateful for people choosing to give their time to help advance research. We really couldn’t do what we do without them,” believes Dr. Genge. “They are incredible people. Many will participate in clinical trials despite having limited time left and knowing that they won’t see the benefit themselves.”A lack of new treatment options and the hope of contributing to a breakthrough therapy prompted Kevin, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) at 60, to take part in a trial. “There hasn’t been a new drug to treat Parkinson’s in decades. But technology keeps advancing. Researchers are going to come up with something that can stop the progression of the disease, like they have for cancer,” he states. The owner of a financial services firm and an avid sportsman who competed in triathlons, Kevin doesn’t want to let PD slow him down. “If a new treatment works, and you’re in that clinical trial, you have access to that treatment right away. That is definitely a plus. If not, you might have to wait years,” he says. Working with Open Science Clinical trials are just the last in a long series of steps needed for a new treatment to be approved (see image 1). Before any treatments can be developed, extensive research is needed into mechanisms underlying the progression of the disease.  Patients can contribute to this crucial early stage by taking part in observational studies and biobanking initiatives, where no drug is being tested.Initiatives at the CRU such as the CAPTURE ALS and DEMySTIFI (Data Extraction in Multiple Sclerosis To Inform Future Interventions) capture patient biosamples and clinical data. These types of initiatives allow researchers around the world to test new hypotheses with a much larger pool of patients – which is key, particularly for rare disease. These initiatives collaborate with The Neuro’s C-BIG Repository, one of the largest biorepositories for neurological disorders in the world.From start to finish, developing and conducting all the phases of a clinical trial takes years. While not all trials will yield an approved treatment, all research helps advance our understanding of a disease and its possible treatment pathways, if only by ruling out certain avenues of study and reorienting research.For Ana, whenever her neurologist proposes a new trial, she is ready to participate. “Without research we are left with the status quo, and for me the status quo is not an option,” she insists.For more about clinical trials at the CRU, visit cru.mcgill.ca.For more on the participating in clinical trials in Canada, consult Health Canada and the It Starts With Me._____Les patients-participants : une force motrice dans la recherche cliniqueLes personnes vivant avec des maladies neurologiques se rendent à l’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro pour retrouver espoir et faire avancer la science Par Sophie Lorenzo, agente de communication, Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro Cette semaine est la semaine « Cerveau en tête », une initiative internationale visant à sensibiliser le public à propos de la recherche en neurosciences. Cette dernière vise à mieux comprendre et traiter des conditions telles que la SLA, la maladie d’Alzheimer, les accidents vasculaires cérébraux et la migraine. L’American Brain Foundation estime qu’il existe 600 maladies neurologiques affectant une personne sur six dans le monde.Chaque nouveau médicament qui se retrouve sur un carnet d’ordonnances au cabinet de votre médecin a dû d’abord passer par un essai clinique pour être évalué en matière d’innocuité et d’efficacité. Pourtant, il y a un élément essentiel dans le processus d’essai clinique qui est rarement mentionné lorsqu’on discute des progrès de la recherche. Cet élément, ce sont les patients. Sans leur participation, les avancées dans le traitement des maladies neurologiques s’arrêteraient.Partenaires du processusLa Dre Angela Genge, neurologue et directrice exécutive de l’URC consulte avec un patient participant à un essai clinique au NeuroTony Revoy/The Neuro Tony Revoy/The NeuroLe fardeau des maladies est très lourd dans le cas des troubles neurologiques, dont plusieurs sont des maladies dégénératives. Les personnes vivant avec ces diagnostics peuvent ressentir une forte motivation pour aider à tester de nouveaux traitements. « Je crois beaucoup au travail des chercheurs. Cela contribue à notre propre espoir en tant que patients », explique Ana*, qui a reçu un diagnostic de sclérose en plaques (SP) récurrente-rémittente il y a plus de 15 ans, alors qu’elle avait 24 ans.Ana s’est vu prescrire des médicaments qui lui ont permis de rester active, de pratiquer le karaté, le tennis et la randonnée pendant plusieurs années, jusqu’à ce que sa SP progresse. C’est alors que son neurologue au Neuro (Institut-Hôpital neurologique de Montréal) lui a proposé de participer à un essai clinique testant un nouveau médicament. « J’ai senti que je devais faire quelque chose. C’est une maladie qui touche beaucoup de jeunes et participer à un essai semblait être un bon moyen de faire avancer la science. »Grâce aux patients, l’éventail des traitements a considérablement changé au cours de la dernière décennie. « Il existe plus de traitements approuvés pour les maladies neurologiques que jamais auparavant », affirme Angela Genge, MD, directrice exécutive de l’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro (URC), l’un des plus grands centres de recherche neurologique au Canada, menant plus de 115 essais cliniques chaque année. « Nous étudions des traitements expérimentaux qui pourraient être les premiers traitements approuvés pour un certain nombre de maladies rares. Et nous étudions également des moyens d’alléger le fardeau de la maladie pour les patients, par exemple avec de nouvelles formulations orales pour des thérapies qui étaient administrées par perfusion IV auparavant. »Au coeur de la recherche cliniqueLes patients sont des partenaires essentiels à l’URC. « Nous sommes reconnaissants aux personnes qui choisissent de donner de leur temps pour faire avancer la recherche. Nous ne pourrions vraiment pas faire ce que nous faisons sans eux », estime la Dre Genge. “Ce sont des gens incroyables. Beaucoup participent à des essais cliniques bien qu’il leur reste peu de temps et qu’ils savent qu’ils n’en verront pas les avantages eux-mêmes. »Le manque de nouvelles options de traitement et l’espoir de contribuer à une thérapie révolutionnaire ont incité Kevin*, qui a reçu un diagnostic de maladie de Parkinson (MP) à 60 ans, à participer à un essai. “Il n’y a pas eu de nouveau médicament pour traiter la maladie de Parkinson depuis des décennies. Mais la technologie ne cesse de progresser. Les chercheurs vont trouver quelque chose qui peut arrêter la progression de la maladie, comme ils l’ont fait pour le cancer », déclare-t-il. Propriétaire d’une société de services financiers et sportif passionné qui a participé à des triathlons, Kevin ne veut pas laisser la MP le ralentir. « Si un nouveau traitement fonctionne et que vous participez à cet essai clinique, vous avez immédiatement accès à ce traitement. C’est définitivement un plus. Sinon, vous devrez peut-être attendre des années », dit-il.Travailler avec la science ouverteLes essais cliniques ne sont que la dernière d’une longue série d’étapes nécessaires à l’approbation d’un nouveau traitement (voir image 1). Avant que des traitements puissent être développés, des recherches approfondies sont nécessaires sur les mécanismes sous-jacents à la progression de la maladie. Les patients peuvent contribuer à ce stade précoce en participant à des études d’observation et à des initiatives de biobanque, où aucun médicament n’est testé.Les initiatives en cours à l’URC telles que CAPTURE SLA et DEMySTIFI (Extraction de données relatives à la SP pour orienter les interventions futures) regroupent des échantillons biologiques de patients ainsi que des données cliniques.  Ces types d’initiatives permettent aux chercheurs du monde entier de tester de nouvelles hypothèses en puisant dans les données d’un groupe beaucoup plus large de patients — ce qui est essentiel, en particulier pour les maladies rares. Ces initiatives travaillent en concert avec le référentiel C-BIG du Neuro, l’un des plus grandes biobanques pour les troubles neurologiques au monde.Du début à la fin, le développement et la conduite de toutes les phases d’un essai clinique prennent des années à mener à terme. Bien que tous les essais ne déboucheront pas sur un traitement approuvé, toutes les recherches contribuent à faire progresser notre compréhension d’une maladie et de ses voies de traitement possibles, ne serait-ce qu’en écartant certaines pistes d’étude et en réorientant la recherche.Pour Ana, chaque fois que son neurologue lui propose un nouvel essai, elle est partante. “Sans recherche, nous nous retrouvons avec le statu quo, et pour moi le statu quo n’est pas une option”, insiste-t-elle.Pour en savoir plus sur les essais cliniques à l’URC, visitez cru.mcgill.ca.Pour plus de détails sur la participation aux essais cliniques au Canada, consultez Santé Canada et Ça commence avec moi.*Afin de protéger la vie privée des patients, des pseudonymes ont été utilisés.","Thu, 03/17/2022 - 09:55"
"McGill sets school record with 184 Academic All-Canadians, led by football program","McGill University established a school record for academic prowess among its varsity sports programs in 2021. A total of 184 student-athletes achieved Academic All-Canadian status, surpassing the previous high of 150 set in 2020. The latest total accounted for 41 per cent of the institution’s 449 student-athletes who were registered in programs sanctioned by U SPORTS.That was part of about 5,500 honourees across the country by U SPORTS, the national governing body for university athletics, which is composed of 58 member institutions. Since 1991, McGill ranks second among all universities with 3,102 Academic All-Canadians, trailing only Alberta (3,228).For the second consecutive year, the football program led all McGill teams with 30 Academic All-Canadians. It was the highest total ever produced by the gridiron squad, surpassing their previous best of 22 established last year.The next highest group was men’s soccer with 20, followed by the women’s track and cross-country programs with a combined 18 honourees. The women’s soccer squad was next with 16. Tied with 15 apiece was women’s swimming and men’s track/cross-country, followed by both hockey teams, which had 14 apiece, and men’s swimming (12).Rounding out the other sports was women’s volleyball (9), women’s rugby (6). women’s basketball (5), men’s basketball (5) and women’s field hockey (5).Forty-five of the McGill laureates achieved a perfect grade-point average of 4.0.The group of McGill high-achievers featured 88 women and 96 men. In terms of academic discipline, Science led all faculties with 65 honourees, followed by Arts (38), Engineering (31), Education (23), Management (19), Arts & Science (3), Medicine (3), Architecture (1) and Social Work (1). The breakdown by class was 55 freshmen, 44 sophomores, 37 juniors and 48 seniors.In order to qualify, a student-athlete must be registered as full-time in a U SPORTS program and have achieved a minimum of 80 per cent in their studies (a 3.7 GPA at McGill). Normally, an honouree must also consuming a year of athletic eligibility but this requirement was waived last year as all university sports programs were halted due to the pandemic.Among the list of outstanding individuals, one female and one male from each of the four U SPORTS conferences will be selected to make up the national top eight, who become recipients of the Governor General’s Academic All-Canadian Commendation.Breakdown of McGill’s 2021 Academic All-CanadiansBY THE NUMBERS:FACULTYScience65Arts38Engineering31Education23Management19Arts & Science3Medicine3Architecture1Social Work1TOTAL:184CLASSFRESHMAN55SOPHOMORE44JUNIOR37SENIOR (4th/5th)48TOTAL:184GRADE POINT AVERAGE4.0453.90-3.99543.80-3.89363.70-3.7949TOTAL:184SPORTFootball (m)30Soccer (m)20Track/Cross-Country (w)18Soccer (w)16Swimming (w)15Track/Cross-Country (m)15Ice Hockey (m)14Ice Hockey (w)14Swimming (m)12Volleyball (w)9Rugby (w)6Basketball (m)5Basketball (w)5Field Hockey (w)5TOTAL:184GENDERMen96Women88TOTAL:184MOTHER TONGUEEnglish144French40TOTAL:184COUNTRYCANADA157USA18FRANCE2LEBANON2AUSTRALIA1BERMUDA1ENGLAND1HONG KONG1UNITED ARAB EMIRATES1TOTAL:184PROVINCE / STATEQuebec87Ontario33British Columbia24Alberta7Illinois (USA)5New Brunswick2FRANCE2LEBANON2Colorado (USA)2Massachusetts (USA)2Minnesota (USA)2Saskatchewan1Nova Scotia1Prince Edward Island1Manitoba1AUSTRALIA1BERMUDA1ENGLAND1HONG KONG1UNITED ARAB EMIRATES1California (USA)1New York (USA)1Ohio (USA)1Pennsylvania (USA)1Vermont (USA)1Washington (USA)1Wisconsin (USA)1TOTAL:184McGill’s 2021 Academic All-Canadians (184) listed by sportFIRSTLAST NAMEGENDER SPORTLANG.ELIG ACADEMIC PROGRAMYRHOMETOWNPROV/STATELeonardoDe ConinckMBASKETBALLFR1Management (Economics & Finance)1St. RaymondQCAntoneyBellMBASKETBALLEN2Arts (History)4WaterlooONSamJenkinsMBASKETBALLEN4Education (Physical & Health)4HamiltonONReleOrimaladeMBASKETBALLEN2Science (Psychology)3EdmontonABSebastienLamauteMBASKETBALLFR1Management (Finance)1St. BrunoQCAmélieRochonWBASKETBALLFR2Medicine2LévisQCCharlotteClaytonWBASKETBALLEN4Science (Pharmacology)4NewmarketONKristyAwikehWBASKETBALLEN1Science (Kinesiology)1MontréalQCMaddyColpittsWBASKETBALLEN2Management (Finance)2FrederictonNBJessicaSalanonWBASKETBALLEN2Management (Finance)2Ile-PerrotQCSarahChristensenWFIELD HOCKEYEN2Science (Physics)3Canberra(AUSTRALIA)AlyssaTongWFIELD HOCKEYEN2Science (Nursing)2CoquitlamBCBrittanyNgWFIELD HOCKEYEN3Arts (International Development Studies)3St. CatharinesONJudyKimWFIELD HOCKEYEN3Science (Kinesiology)3VictoriaBCEleanorMorrisonWFIELD HOCKEYEN2Engineering (Mechanical)2DeltaBCJoshCampbellMFOOTBALLEN1Engineering (Mechanical)2Red DeerABConradMahonyMFOOTBALLEN3Management (Finance)3TorontoONDimitriosSinodinosMFOOTBALLEN4Engineering (Electrical)4LavalQCNassibHassounaMFOOTBALLEN2Engineering (Bioengineering)2VerdunQCWilliamLanglaisMFOOTBALLFR1Education (Physical & Health)2MontréalQCNicolasBarnesMFOOTBALLFR1Science (Kinesiology)2GatineauQCJérémyLangevinMFOOTBALLFR2Science (Kinesiology)2GatineauQCGabrielFaucherMFOOTBALLFR1Science (Kinesiology)1LévisQCTristanFleuryMFOOTBALLFR4Science (Kinesiology)4Deux-MontagnesQCMatthewMartinMFOOTBALLEN1Management (Finance)2TorontoONAndrewSeinet-SpauldingMFOOTBALLEN5Social Work5MontréalQCMustapha Al BachirFayeMFOOTBALLEN1Arts (Economics)2LongueuilQCNicolasBaillargeonMFOOTBALLFR3Education (Elementary)3SherbrookeQCGeorgeAifantisMFOOTBALLEN1Arts (Industrial & Labour Relations)1LavalQCOlivierTherrienMFOOTBALLFR5Engineering (Electrical)5Trois-RivièresQCLiam GikwongGi-KwongMFOOTBALLEN1Education (Physical & Health)1St. EustacheQCWilliamRiddleMFOOTBALLEN1Management (Accounting)1MontréalQCLeoTischhauserMFOOTBALLFR3Management (Sustainability)3MontréalQCAlexandreParéMFOOTBALLEN5Science (Neuroscience)1NeuvilleQCKlausCalixteMFOOTBALLFR1Arts (Economics)1MontréalQCGuillaumeBélandMFOOTBALLFR4Management (Finance)4Town of Mt.

Planning greener and happier cities,"Projects by Raja Sengupta (left) and Christopher Barrington-Leigh are being funded by the McGill Bieler School of Environment The McGill Bieler School of Environment (BSE) has announced its first annual round of “Spark” and “Ignite” funded research projects. Spark and Ignite are ongoing funding programs designed to help the BSE continue its important work to find interdisciplinary solutions to complex environmental challenges. Among the projects are two that carefully look at how we can improve our cities here in Canada, and make our urban environments greener, healthier, and even happier, worldwide.Little green spacesBieler School and Geography Associate Professor Raja Sengupta’s Spark project (with a grant up to $7500) “Can Greenspace Composition and Placement Ameliorate Urban Heat Islands?” conducted with Civil Engineering Professor Laxmi Sushama, examines the urban phenomenon of heat-related mortality in Montreal, due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI is a growing problem in cities across the world, exacerbated in expanding urban regions due to higher night-time temperatures and increased energy for air conditioning. UHI is typically associated with city centres and densely-packed, less affluent neighbourhoods.“The temperatures in the heart of the city can be up to about 6-7 degrees higher,” explains Sengupta. “If you go to the dense parts of the city, say the East Side, if there’s a heat wave ongoing where there’s a lot of stifling heat, people can have mortality related to this urban heat effect. So it’s a climatic problem that we’ve created which is beginning to have serious human-related consequences.”Urban greenspaces (such as parks, woodlands, or Montreal’s “ruelles vertes” – green alleyways) can ameliorate UHI and reduce temperature in their immediate vicinity, but the relationship between the size of a greenspace and its ability to reduce UHI is still debated. This collaboration, combining Sengupta and Sushama’s strengths in geographic information science (GIScience), high-resolution climate modeling and environmental injustice, will gather data from humidity sensors at and around McGill’s Downtown and MacDonald campuses and mobile devices, and then use a micro-scale Urban climate model. Ultimately it would like to demonstrate the importance of “little green spaces” when it comes improving quality of life in urban, densely built-up environments.“My research is trying to prove that little green spaces have an impact,” says Sengupta. “They are easier than buying up large tracts of land and converting them. A little bit more greenery around us could have multiple benefits, not just for urban heat. Eventually I’d like policy in the city of Montreal that advocates for small green spaces. I want to be able to quantitively prove it, because everybody asks ‘what’s the value of the greenspace?’ Well, here it is. If you have a lot of little green spaces, a one-degree temperature reduction is quite a bit.”Creating new standards for building resilient neighbourhoodsChristopher Barrington-Leigh, Associate Professor in the Bieler School of Environment and McGill Institute for Health and Social Policy, is an economist who studies the topic of happiness relating to social, economic, and environmental factors. His Ignite project (with a grant up to $25,000) “Street Network Sprawl and Environmental and Social Outcomes in Canada” examines the long-term consequences of city planning at the street network level, and its impact on our daily lives.“What are humanity’s most critical long-run climate-relevant investments?” asks Barrington-Leigh. “Energy infrastructure? Residential and commercial buildings? A mostly overlooked contender of enormous scale are the street networks that are laid down during urban expansion. Buildings come and go, but the local residential street layout is generally permanent over centuries, not decades.”The pace of worldwide urbanization is so high as to make the decisions about how urban streets are configured one of the largest, most permanent and far-reaching investments humans are making.“Humanity is building new city developments not only faster than it ever has before, but also faster than it ever will again,” says Barrington-Leigh. “The planet’s population is undergoing the last phase of becoming urbanized, a once-only process resulting from technological advance and centralization of resources.” The scale of this process is unprecedented, and the year prior to the pandemic, the movement of humans to urban regions likely reached the highest it ever will – just under 80 million people per year moving to cities. This means designing and building the equivalent of an entire Canada of new city roads, homes, and infrastructure every five months.This Ignite project will see Barrington-Leigh collaborate with Bieler School of Environment and Department of Geography Associate Professor Kevin Manaugh, a specialist in transport equity: both will co-supervise incoming master’s student Fajle Rabbi Ashik, to use high-resolution data and evaluate the long-term effects of street network style on human lives and happiness.“The hope is to create new standards for building future-proof, resilient neighbourhoods, favouring high street connectivity and adaptability,” explains Barrington-Leigh, “so that future cities can offer mixed use, walkable, and diverse neighbourhoods. For all the reasons we care about urban form – health, environment, social capital, and happiness – this simple constraint on developers would allow future communities the most options.”","Tue, 03/15/2022 - 12:11"
Société des Alcools du Québec (SAQ) and Bensadoun School join forces,"Consumer behaviour has changed dramatically during the pandemic. Public health restrictions have played a major role, but a trend toward e-commerce and omni-channel retail was already underway. It has only accelerated.“Companies now need to show a lot of creativity and resilience. External factors are having a huge impact on operations,” says Charles de Brabant, Executive Director of the Bensadoun School of Retail Management at McGill University. “Consumer behaviour changes, technology changes, and now supply chain disruptions are causing inflationary pressures.“There is a shortage of talent of all types. Innovation is now a requirement – every functional area of the retail industry needs analytic skills. From a strategic planning perspective, companies must consider things that could fundamentally alter what they need to do. They need to be agile and flexible,” says de Brabant.Enter the Retail Innovation ChallengeTo answer this call, a competition organized by the Bensadoun School of Retail Management asks students to do exactly that. The Retail Innovation Challenge is a three-stage competition in which teams of students provide small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with business plans to navigate the real-world challenges they are facing. It is open to students in any discipline from any university in Canada, and this year’s grand prize-winning team will take home $10,000.This generous award is being made possible by a five-year, $250,000 donation from the Société des Alcools du Québec (SAQ), the crown corporation that sells and distributes alcohol in Québec.“Supporting the future of retail business is one of SAQ’s sponsorship priorities, and the Retail Innovation Challenge gives us a front row seat to the future of our industry,” says Emmanuelle Roy, the Associate Director of Event Marketing & Sponsorship at SAQ. “For the SAQ, it is important to contribute to the training of the next generation of retailers. As you know, our industry is evolving at a very rapid pace. The Bensadoun School’s approach, based on innovation, will enable them to meet the many challenges ahead,” says Ms. Roy. “The Retail Innovation Challenge competition will already put them to the test in this regard. This is a unique opportunity to demonstrate creativity, to propose solutions adapted to real issues and to contribute to the development of innovative solutions.”Homegrown talent de chez nousMany of the businesses that participate in the Retail Innovation Challenge are based in Quebec. And for the Bensadoun School, this is an opportunity to build relationships locally.“The SAQ is a benchmark for customer service and is one of the most admired companies in Quebec,” says de Brabant. “They have worked to promote an ecosystem of local suppliers, and their support for the Retail Innovation Challenge helps deepen the Bensadoun School’s ties with Quebec’s business ecosystem. Our overall vision is to be the world’s best academic institution dedicated to the future of retail, and we are striving toward that, but we also have a role to play in our communities.”“We all know this past year has been a challenge” says Professor Saibal Ray, Academic Director of the Bensadoun School, “and while some plans were put on pause, the Bensadoun School proved to be as resilient as retail itself, nimbly pivoting to meet the needs of students and continuing to build strong relationships with our partners and local communities.”For students, the Retail Innovation Challenge is also a way to engage with business leaders. They get an opportunity to directly advise SMEs, and teams that make the second round of the competition receive coaching by a globally recognized management consulting firm.“If companies are seeking to change the paradigm in which they are looking at things, student input can be valuable,” says de Brabant. “Sometimes students have very interesting ways of looking at business differently. Will the advice be directly implementable at the end of the three-week competition? Probably not, but it can be one extra data point of validation for a particular decision, and it can be food for thought.”The 2022 edition of the Retail Innovation Challenge runs March 3-20. Please visit the RIC website for more details.","Fri, 03/11/2022 - 11:00"

"Plus de 3,9 millions de dollars amassés pendant McGill24 pour soutenir des causes à l’échelle de toute l’Université dans le cadre de cette septième journée annuelle du don","(de gauche à droite): Alyson Jiang, Sofia Paoli, Emma Paulus, et Elaine Xing Owen Egan / Joni Dufour Le 9 mars, la communauté mondiale de l’Université McGill s’est unie une fois de plus dans le cadre de McGill24 et a amassé un montant de 3 949 997 $ en 24 heures en cette septième édition de la journée annuelle du don de l’Université. Cette année, McGill24 s’est déroulé alors que l’Université termine ses célébrations du bicentenaire et entre dans son troisième siècle d’existence. Le thème de la campagne visait à engager une réflexion sur les 200 raisons qui poussent à donner. Les fonds recueillis grâce aux 5 901 dons reçus aideront les étudiants, les étudiants-athlètes, les chercheurs et les futurs leaders de McGill à contribuer concrètement aux changements à l’Université, dans leurs collectivités et partout dans le monde.Alors que toute la planète suit avec inquiétude la crise humanitaire qui se déroule en Europe de l’Est et que nous poursuivons la gestion des répercussions continues de la pandémie de COVID-19, la campagne numérique de 24 heures de cette année invitait les anciens étudiants, les amis, le corps professoral, les membres du personnel et la population étudiante de McGill à faire preuve de générosité afin de soutenir les programmes étudiants, les facultés et les départements de l’ensemble de l’Université, y compris les projets qui donneront aux étudiants les moyens de relever bon nombre des défis mondiaux les plus difficiles.« La communauté de McGill s’est vraiment mobilisée pour soutenir notre projet communautaire », a déclaré Andrew Dixon, B. Sc. 2015, M. Sc. 2017, étudiant en médecine qui a obtenu son diplôme cette année et directeur exécutif de Community Health and Social Medicine (CHASM), l’une des initiatives de sociofinancement publicisées pendant McGill24. « Nous sommes vraiment reconnaissants de la générosité des donateurs et des dons de contrepartie débloqués. Grâce à eux, l’initiative CHASM est en mesure d’élargir la portée de sa mission qui vise à rapprocher les étudiants et les organismes communautaires pour mieux lutter contre les inégalités en matière de santé. Il sera maintenant possible d’avoir les ressources nécessaires pour soutenir l’innovation sociale dirigée par la communauté et les étudiants à Montréal. »Les conversations en ligne #McGill24 et #200raisonsdedonner, ainsi que les événements virtuels et en présentiel organisés partout dans le monde, sont la preuve de l’enthousiasme de notre communauté internationale et de l’effet d’entraînement que leurs dons peuvent susciter.« McGill24 est devenu un moyen incroyable pour les membres de la communauté de McGill de s’inspirer mutuellement pour redonner à l’Université », a déclaré Marc Weinstein, vice-principal à l’Avancement universitaire de McGill. « Nos étudiants, anciens diplômés, professeurs, membres du personnel, parents et amis de McGill ont tous de bonnes raisons de donner généreusement. Partout sur nos campus, nous voyons nos remarquables étudiants, professeurs et chercheurs contribuer à la découverte et à l’apprentissage, et ce type de soutien leur permet de pousser encore plus loin leurs ambitions. »La campagne de cette année comprenait des mesures incitatives, comme des défis de financement et des dons de contrepartie. Brièvement, des dons supplémentaires étaient versés lorsque des objectifs de financement précis étaient atteints. Un nombre record de projets dirigés par des étudiants ont également fait l’objet de promotion sur la plateforme de sociofinancement de l’Université, Sociofinancement McGill. En tout, des équipes représentant 61 projets ont recueilli des fonds indispensables pendant McGill24 pour soutenir des projets étudiants de recherche et d’action directe, des équipes de génie, des programmes sportifs et bien d’autres initiatives.« Le soutien des donateurs m’a ouvert tant de portes », a exprimé Rele Orimalade, un étudiant en sciences qui obtiendra son diplôme en 2022. « En tant que joueur de basketball du Redbird, j’ai vu des donateurs financer des bourses sportives, de l’équipement sportif, des voyages, des repas et plus encore. En dehors du terrain, la générosité des donateurs m’a permis d’obtenir un poste de recherche dans un laboratoire de biologie où j’ai acquis de précieuses connaissances pratiques. »Tous les fonds récoltés pendant McGill24 iront à Forgé par McGill : la campagne de notre troisième siècle, une collecte de fonds échelonnée sur plusieurs années qui vise à amasser 2 milliards de dollars. McGill a lancé cette campagne à l’automne 2019 pour soutenir ses grandes ambitions à l’occasion de son 200e anniversaire.Visitez le site Web du McGill24 pour avoir plus d’information et connaître les statistiques à propos des objectifs atteints pendant la campagne de cette année.","Thu, 03/10/2022 - 13:14"

McGill24 raises $3.95 million for causes across the University in seventh annual day of giving,"(Left to right): Alyson Jiang, Sofia Paoli, Emma Paulus, and Elaine Xing of the Win4Science crowdfunding teamOwen Egan / Joni Dufour On March 9, the global McGill University community came together once again to make a difference on McGill24, raising a record $3,949,997 in 24 hours during the seventh edition of the University’s annual day of giving. This year’s McGill24 took place as the University wraps up its bicentennial celebrations and kicks off its third century, with a theme that inspired the community to reflect on 200 reasons to give. Funds raised from 5,901 donations will support McGill’s students, student-athletes, researchers and future leaders making a difference at the University, in their communities, and around the world.As the world watches with concern the humanitarian crisis unfolding in eastern Europe and continues to manage the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s 24-hour digital campaign asked McGill’s alumni, friends, faculty, staff and students to donate in support of student programs, faculties and departments across the University, including projects that will empower students to address many of our most difficult global challenges.“The McGill community really stepped up and came together to support our community project,” says Andrew Dixon, BSc’15, MSc’17, a medical student graduating this year and executive director of the Community Health and Social Medicine (CHASM) Incubator, one of the crowdfunding initiatives promoted during McGill24. “We are so grateful for the generosity shown by donors and the matching gifts they enabled. With it, CHASM is able to expand its work bridging the gap between students and community organizations to tackle health inequities. It provides us with the resources to support community-led and student-powered social innovation in Montreal.”The online #McGill24 and #200reasonstogive conversations, along with virtual and in-person events held around the world, demonstrated the enthusiasm of our global community and the ripple effect that their giving can have.“McGill24 has become an incredible way for members of the McGill community to inspire one another to give back to the University,” says Marc Weinstein, Vice-Principal of McGill University Advancement. “Our McGill students, alumni, faculty, staff, parents and friends all have their reasons for giving generously. Everywhere you look on our campuses, you can see our remarkable students, faculty and researchers contributing to discovery and learning, and this kind of support allows them to reach even higher in their ambitions.”This year’s campaign featured giving incentives such as donor-contributed challenge funds and matching gifts that were released when specific donation targets were met. There were also a record number of student-led projects promoted on McGill Crowdfunding, the University’s updated crowdfunding platform. Overall, teams representing 61 projects raised much-needed funds during McGill24 to support student research and outreach programs, Engineering design teams, Athletics programs, and many more initiatives.“Donor support has opened so many doors for me,” says Rele Orimalade, a Science student set to graduate in 2022. “As a Redbird basketball player, I saw donor support fund athletics scholarships, sports’ gear, trips, team meals and more. Off the court, it made it possible for me to earn a research position in a biology lab where I gained invaluable hands-on experience.”All funds raised during McGill24 count towards Made by McGill: the Campaign for Our Third Century, the multi-year, $2-billion fundraising drive that McGill launched in fall 2019 to support its bold ambitions as it celebrates its 200th anniversary and looks to its next century.Visit the McGill24 website for more information and statistics about this year’s campaign achievements.","Thu, 03/10/2022 - 12:26"
Training the new generation of cybersecurity professionals,"In an age where daily tasks such as banking and grocery shopping are done online and more and more people have relied on the internet to stay connected during pandemic lockdowns, it comes as no surprise that, due to our increasing reliance on internet-based technology, cybersecurity has now become more essential than ever before. The increasing prevalence of cyber-attacks on IT infrastructure shows us the need for a new generation of cybersecurity professionals who are equipped with the knowledge and techniques to protect not only an organization’s information but our own privacy as well.McGill’s School of Information Studies is looking to address these concerns and rectify the current gap of cybersecurity professionals in the industry today with their new Online Graduate Certificate in Cybersecurity.  Designed to equip IT professionals with both the technical skills to prevent cyberattacks and the managerial skills required in creating and implementing effective security policy within their organizations, McGill’s new certificate could be a step in the right direction to meet your current cybersecurity needs.“We hope that this certificate would set the pace for other universities to catch up to this balance of practice and theory to shape the future of cybersecurity training” says the School’s director, Professor Kimiz Dalkir.Burgeoning cybersecurity fieldAs public and private sectors continue to invest more funds and resources into cybersecurity, university training programs now need to rethink and assess how they will train their graduates in meeting the high demand for cybersecurity experts.According to a Cybersecurity Workforce Study and ISACA State of Cybersecurity Update in 2021, the global shortage of cybersecurity professionals is 2.72 million. Bridging this employment gap is now more crucial than ever.“In the next couple of years, you will see big changes within Quebec,” says Professor Benjamin Fung, McGill’s Canada Research Chair in Data Mining for Cybersecurity. “More and more security and privacy regulations, such as Quebec’s Bill 64, means that by 2023, more companies will have no choice but to adhere to those requirements.”Taking the lead Given the increasing demand in cybersecurity trained professionals, universities like McGill are taking the lead in training students in this area. The role of IT professionals in cybersecurity is to identify the needs in both the public and private sectors, which share a common need in cybersecurity and provide adequate training to fill that gap. Research is another key component in ensuring that IT professionals are being proactive, and not reactive when it comes to cybersecurity threats. “Attackers are always improving and evolving,” says Fung, “We need to keep implementing new techniques and proposing new techniques to further strengthen our systems.”The course will give students valuable hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities and threats within various systems and train students in managing and responding to information security threats, as well as the skills to form security policy and governance. The “virtual lab”, simulation exercises which will allow students to access real systems and examine vulnerabilities, allows students to discover how and why an attack has occurred, what to do in tracing back its origins and how to lock files on different systems.“The biggest challenge is improving cyber-resilience within systems,” says Fung. “It’s not about just trying to ‘patch’ up a system when an attack happens. We want to identify the vulnerability before the attack happens and we want to have adequate training not just for the technical staff, but everyone within the company. Most attacks start from a wrong click that has some malicious software.”Educating usersIndeed, wide-scale training within organizations is crucial in improving the resilience of systems. But our increasing reliance on technology means that many people are ill-equipped with the necessary digital and privacy literacy needed to prevent cyberattacks from happening.What can institutions like McGill do to sensitize and educate members of its community to this new need for digital and privacy literacy? On January 28, 2022, McGill marked Data Privacy Day with a series of events such as a lecture by McGill Law professor Allen Mendelsohn on the impact of Bill 64 and a workshop on secure meetings and webinars. As an official 2022 Data Privacy Day champion, McGill’s goal was to highlight how students, faculty and staff can learn about the skills and tools required to protect their data.Resources such as McGill’s Digital Research Services, help by giving students and researchers advice and support on research data management, research software and advanced research computing.

Macdonald Campus students celebrate the women of the CIUSSS West Island on International Women’s Day,"MNA Greg Kelley talks with students at the School of Human Nutrition.Earlier today, students in the School of Human Nutrition expressed their gratitude to a group of women who have been serving on the frontlines in the battle against COVID-19 since its onset: those working in the Montreal West Island Integrated University Health and Social Services Centre (CIUSSS). The community-outreach initiative saw 600 meals delivered to CIUSSS employees, that were planned, prepared, packaged and delivered by students in the School’s Dietetics and Nutrition program.“Part of the dietetics program involves understanding how to manage a food service operation, and the best way to learn to do that is to give students a hands-on opportunity to do just that,” explained Paul-Guy Duhamel, a Faculty Lecturer in McGill’s School of Human Nutrition and Manager of the university’s Food and Nutrition Laboratories.In the fall, students are asked to propose a business development project and build a strategic plan around its execution, which takes place several months later in the winter semester. “Students often come to realize that the project they have in mind in September is different from the one they are able to execute in the winter or spring, and they learn to adapt,” said Duhamel. “It’s an opportunity to experience handling the logistical side of a food service-based operation, including how to manage a budget and stay on schedule.”CIUSSS employees were offered a choice of three meal options with either meat-based, vegetarian, or plant-based protein pasta sauce. Each meal package included pasta, cheese, and a salad with a homemade vinaigrette and was designed to feed four.  The meals were prepared over a 6-week period leading up to the event, during which time students learned that there are a variety of factors to consider when it comes to large-scale food preparation.“One of the biggest challenges is human resources, like finding volunteers for food prep and packaging,” said Karelle Côté, a student in her qualifying year of the master’s degree in dietetics. “You need to ensure you have enough people to handle the work but not so many that you become inefficient.”It’s also important to consider the availability of the equipment needed to prepare those foods, Côté added. “If you’re limited to certain pots, for example, you may not be able to make as much sauce, even though you have a lot of volunteers and ingredients at hand. There’s a lot of scheduling involved which can make a large-scale meal event logistically challenging to plan.”Food and the human connection As a volunteer at his local West Island CIUSSS vaccination site, Duhamel couldn’t help but notice that most of the workers were women from various disciplines who, in the face of uncertainty and fear surrounding COVID-19, had risen to the challenge—registering, guiding, swabbing, vaccinating, observing and managing these centres, and doing it well.“It came to a point where I felt we had to do something to recognize the contribution being made by the women at these screening and vaccination sites. They believe in and are invested in what they do and have devoted the last two years to bettering the health of our community,” said Duhamel. “It’s no small feat.”It was also an environment reminiscent of the one Duhamel works in, Dietetics and Nutrition, dominated by dedicated women who make up 94 per cent of the industry’s professional workforce. So, when the idea was proposed to use the meal project to celebrate the women of The Montreal West Island’s CIUSSS on International Women’s Day, it wasn’t hard for the program’s largely female student body to get on board.“To be able to give back and show our support to everyone who has been on the frontlines of this pandemic, particularly the women, is so important. We hope to be able to put a smile on their faces, encourage them to keep moving forward, and to show them that we really do appreciate them,” said Samiha Younes, a second-year Dietetics program student who helped manage the project.According to Younes, initiatives like these allow students the opportunity to experience the larger implications of food beyond nutrition and physical health—it helps them understand the integral role that food plays in establishing and fostering human connection.“When you first head into this program, you see food as its components: macronutrients, calories, and carbs, but once you start manipulating the food, you feel like there’s a whole story behind it. There’s a financial part, a cultural part, and the sheer pleasure of sharing a meal with someone. Our Food Guide actually encourages you to enjoy food with others because it’s meaningful,” Younes added. Therefore, it seemed a natural way to thank this dedicated workforce, who have collectively administered over 500,000 screening tests and roughly 700,000 vaccines since the onset of the pandemic.A community effort McGill students weren’t the only ones inspired to give. In fact, the project was made possible thanks to funding from the Brown Martlet Funding Committee of the Martlet Foundation and financial contributions from businesses, community members, and local politicians, including McGill alumnus Greg Kelley (BA’09), MNA for Jacques-Cartier.“As the brother of four dynamic, generous women, I recognize and cherish women’s contribution to our society,” said Kelley. “As an MNA who has the benefit of having the Lakeshore General Hospital and many seniors’ residences in his riding, I am immensely proud of the many sacrifices healthcare workers have made to keep our community safe.”Donations came in other forms, too, including ingredients from Métro Plus Lachine and Provigo Baie d’ Urfé, and fresh, locally-sourced produce from Lufa Farms, co-founded by alumna Lauren Rathmell (BSc’10).“Lufa Farms is proud to donate produce to help out initiatives like these ones. It warms our hearts to know that women at CIUSSS West Island sites will be recognized for all the hard work they’ve done for the community these past months,” said Lufa Farms in a statement. “Giving back to the community is something we value, and supporting our co-CEO’s alma mater at the same time makes it even better.”The Cities of Baie d’Urfé and Beaconsfield generously lent transportation vehicles to the cause, while the food service management team—alongside roughly 40 additional student volunteers—spent the morning packing vehicles with meals and receiving deliveries at various West Island CIUSSS locations, including testing centers in Kirkland, Lachine and Verdun, and vaccination centers in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Pierrefonds, Pointe-Claire. The last stop was the Dollard St-Laurent Civic Centre in Lasalle at noon, where the Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and Associate Vice-Principal (Macdonald Campus) Anja Geitmann, MNA Hélène David (Marguerite-Bourgeoys), and Amine Saadi, Assistant Director of Specialized Mental Health and Addiction Services at The Montreal West Island CIUSSS, gathered to thank all those involved.The gift of gratitude In a brief address, Amine Saadi, representing The Montreal West Island CIUSSS, expressed his gratitude to McGill and its students for making the event possible.Dean Geitmann responded in kind, thanking the women­—and all employees—at The Montréal West Island CIUSSS sites for their ongoing dedication in the face of the pandemic, often persevering in the face of public fear and doubt. “Thanks to you, we are on the cusp of normal life. You have made that possible. On behalf of the School of Human Nutrition and the McGill community, I thank you.”Paul-Guy Duhamel also took a moment to acknowledge the abundant generosity that made this event possible, including donations from MNAs Enrico Ciccone (Marquette), Hélène David (Marguerite-Bourgeoys), Monsef Derraji (Nelligan), Greg Kelley (Jacques-Cartier), and Carlos J. Leitão (Robert-Baldwin), and others whose contributions helped ensure the success of the project.“McGill and our students are grateful for the opportunity to help them learn and grow their skills. The experience is invaluable and will help propel them into future careers in the fields of Dietetics and Nutrition.”","Tue, 03/08/2022 - 15:34"
Cindy Blackstock named one of Canada’s women of influence,"Cindy Blackstock has been honoured by the Women of Influence organizationCindy Blackstock, a professor at the School of Social Work, has been named one of Canada’s Top 25 Women of Influence.The annual list is compiled by the Women of Influence organization to “recognize the extraordinary accomplishments of Canada’s self-identified women and gender-diverse role models. The recipients have all left their mark over the past year: contributing to the greater good through their initiatives; using their influence to drive positive change; or reaching inspiring heights on a global stage.”Advocating for Indigenous children’s rightsA member of the Gitksan First Nation and Executive Director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, Blackstock is Canada’s foremost Indigenous children’s rights advocate. She has dedicated her professional life to addressing systemic discrimination in the child welfare system. For more than 30 years, she has engaged in and promoted public education and key research on the issue, publishing more than 75 articles on topics relating to reconciliation, Indigenous theory, First Nations child welfare and human rights.In its citation, the Women of Influence praised Blackstock for her pivotal role in the landmark $40 billion agreement reached on December 31, 2021, between the Canadian government and First Nations leaders, whereby First Nations children who were harmed by Canada’s discriminatory child welfare system may be compensated. The agreement marked the culmination of 15 years of public pressure and litigation.“While the federal government still has much work to do to deliver on promises made, Cindy’s relentless pursuit of accountability and justice has been instrumental in holding the Canadian government responsible and calling attention to the rights of Indigenous children across the nation,” said the citation.Subject of documentaryIn January 2021, MacLean’s Magazine named Blackstock one of Canada’s 50 most influential people, calling her “a relentless champion of Indigenous children’s rights.”Blackstock is also well-known for her leadership in bringing a human rights complaint against the federal government, resulting in a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal’s landmark ruling in 2016, in which the Tribunal found that the Government of Canada “was guilty of systemic discrimination by underfunding child welfare for First Nations children on reserve.”The court case and Blackstock’s role is the subject of a 2016 documentary film We Can’t Make the Same Mistake Twice.Learn more about the 2022 Top 25 Women of Influence.","Tue, 03/08/2022 - 14:23"
Paying tribute to lives well-lived and well-loved,"Today, on International Women’s Day, we feature stories about inspirational women as told by members of the McGill community.The submissions are diverse, coming from students, staff and faculty, and celebrating everyone from researchers to relatives (lots of moms!), athletes to artists, and students to supervisors. But, this diversity is tied together by the common threads of love and admiration.The women featured here have had a profound impact on the lives of others. They have taught invaluable lessons from classrooms and kitchens, from prison and palliative care. All of those lessons come in the form of lives well-lived and well-loved.Elizabeth BrancoBy Tammy Lynda Cree Program Administrator, International Masters for Health LeadershipElizabeth Branco (left) and Tammy Lynda CreeI want to put a spotlight on my colleague, supervisor and dear friend, Elizabeth Branco. Liz has been an important part of my life since I began my McGill career, but since 2020, she has really become a pillar of strength for me.Like many, the pandemic hit my mental health in a very detrimental way. Liz was always there to listen to me and provide an important outsider’s perspective to whatever I was facing at the moment. During a particularly dark period, she encouraged me to seek out help, not stopping until I finally realized that I needed help. I think what Liz helped me the most with, is realizing that there is no shame in reaching out for help and taking the time you need to get better. I can’t help but wonder how wonderful the work environment would be if everyone had a supervisor like I did.Saying thank you is far too little to express how I feel. I am a better employee and overall person now because of her support. But more importantly, my daughter still has her mother around because someone cared enough to convince me to get help. Thank you, Liz!****SkawennatiSkawennati Roger LemoyneBy Vanessa Racine, Administrative Coordinator, Indigenous Studies and Community Engagement InitiativeSomeone that comes to mind for me is Skawennati. Skawennati is a Mohawk multimedia artist, best known for her online works as well as Machinima that explore contemporary Indigenous cultures, and what Indigenous life might look like in futures inspired by science fiction.Her work is very inspirational to me and I would not have imagined myself continuing my education in Indigenous Futurism had I not met her through the Knowledge Holder Series that was held by Indigenous Studies. She Falls for Ages, a futuristic re-telling of Sky Woman, continues to be an inspiration for re-envisioning Indigenous identity as we move forward in a digital age.****Nadia ChaudhriBy Allison Gonsalves, Director, Science Education LaboratoriesThe person who has most impacted my life over this past year is Professor Nadia Chaudhri, a neuroscientist in the Department of Psychology, Concordia University. I did not know Prof. Chaudhri personally but I did get to know her in a way through her Twitter account, and I followed her journey through the last few months of her life as she received palliative care for ovarian cancer.Nadia ChaudhriProf. Chaudhri’s Twitter presence was uplifting and life affirming, and her journey prompted me to reflect deeply on my own mortality and purpose in academic life. She taught me (and many others) so much about what it can be like to have a good death, and how to live with a terminal diagnosis by reflecting upon, experiencing and relishing life, right to the end.She also manifested the kind of academic career I truly hope I can have, putting compassion and care for her students and colleagues first, and still pursuing her science with a passion. At the end of her life, she chose to spend her time fundraising to support under-represented students in neuroscience, establishing the Nadia Chaudhri Wingspan Award, which you can still donate to. She also spent time raising awareness for ovarian cancer and the DOvEEgene (Developing and Validating a Novel Molecular Screening Test for the Early Diagnosis of Cancer of the Endometrium, Tubes and Ovaries ) initiative. https://rimuhc.ca/whru-doveegeneHer life and death were nothing short of inspirational, and I feel very lucky to have been among the many who were touched by her remarkable life.Xingong Li (left) and Zi Wang****Xingong Li – my momBy Zi Wang, Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemistry My mom inspires me to dream big and follow my true calling. Every day she inspires me in the way she lives her life. She has a big heart, and she taught me that the smallest acts of kindness can go a long way. My mom has always been my role model and my best friend.****Inspiring womenBy Kathy MacLean, Manager, Communications and Planning, Macdonald CampusLet me tell you about a few inspiring women.They are the women who care for younger and older members of their extended families while holding down full-time jobs.They are the work-from-home mothers who fought to ensure that their children stayed healthy and well-adjusted over the past two years.They are the women who work two jobs, scrimp, and save to make ends meet.They are the former colleague who has dedicated the early years of retirement to caring for a friend in need.They are the family friend, a retired teacher, who, throughout her long career and own generosity, ensured that less fortunate kids had food in their stomachs and clothes on their backs.We are all blessed to have these women in our lives.****Julia V. BurnierBy Prisca Bustamante, PhD Candidate, Department of PathologyJulia V. BurnierIt is with great honour to name my supervisor Dr. Julia V. Burnier  as a woman who inspires me. Dr. Burnier is a junior scientist at the Cancer Research Program at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.Her research focuses on understanding the dynamic molecular changes during tumor progression and metastasis by using non-invasive approaches. Dr. Burnier’s goal is to develop sensitive and accurate prognostic biomarkers as well as identify novel targeted therapeutic strategies. Working with Dr. Burnier has been one of my most rewarding experiences, she always seeks to realize the full potential of all lab members, motivate us to give our best effort, and facilitate opportunities for our professional and personal development. She has also created a safe and inclusive workplace where she fosters collaboration among us.Altogether, I would like to express my appreciation and recognition to Dr. Burnier on this International Women’s Day.****Diana Grier AytonDiana Grier AytonBy Daniel McCabe, Editor, McGill News Alumni MagazineOne of the inspiring women I encountered in my life was the person who first hired me to work at McGill – Diana Grier Ayton.Being the associate editor of the McGill Reporter was my first full-time “grown-up” job and I was unsure of myself for the first few weeks, but her confidence in me helped me to build up my own confidence. She was kind and supportive and a lot of fun to be with. She had a knack for hiring good people, people who weren’t always obvious picks with sparkling CVs. That might have had something to do with her own background. She didn’t complete her university studies and she had little editorial experience when she was hired at the Reporter. She was an administrative assistant for a prominent cardiac surgeon at the Montreal Children’s Hospital – not an unimportant job, to be sure, but not one that gave her the chance to make the best use of her creative talents. Someone gave her that chance and she ran with it, winning a pile of awards for her work as the editor of the Reporter, and then the McGill News.I’ve had the opportunity to freelance for several publications over the years, and I can honestly say that Diana is the best editor I have ever worked for.****Nancy PartnerBy Elsbeth Heaman, Professor, Department of History and Classical StudiesIt was my privilege and luck to have been taught by Nancy Partner, one of McGill’s all-time great historians, very recently retired. Her historiography courses were an opening door. Her advice on how to read meaning into formal and informal narrative structures, how to parse rhetoric and genre and intellectual context, seemed to make the entire field of history legible and inviting, from Herodotus and Thucydides to Hayden White and Paul Ricoeur. She made everything more interesting. I cannot say how much she enriched my intellectual life, except to say that I’m just now publishing a book – on Hume and historiography, carried into Canadian history – that began as a term paper for her class.****The women of the Daryanani familyFrom left to right: Amrita Daryanani, Tripta Daryanani, Sanju Daryanani, Kanchan Daryanani and Darshan DaryananiBy Darshan Daryanani, President of the Students’ Society of McGill University (2021-2022) Happy Women’s Day! I am honoured to have been raised and surrounded by such inspirational women. I would like to take this opportunity to honour the Daryanani women:To my beloved mother,There aren’t enough words in the world to thank you for all you’ve done for me. You loved me and cared for me as I grew from nothing. From nothing, you raised me into the man I am today. For all the times I never said thank you, I thank you now more than ever. Thank you for your strength, love, laughter, and most of all, your hope.To my strong sisters,Thank you for being my best friends – not only by default, from birth – but by choice. Thank you for all the traveling, adventures and endless inside jokes, and being the people that I know I can always count on. Thank you for teaching me to lift each other up instead of putting each other down. We lift each other when our days are grey and shine much brighter when we’re together.****Yolanda CisnerosBy Karina Morales RomeroYolanda Cisneros (my grandmother) has taught me some of the most important lessons in life without realizing it, this is because she has rarely needed words to share them; it is through her actions that I’ve come to decipher them.Yolanda CisnerosMy grandmother was born in Puruándiro, a small town in Mexico, she only received a basic primary education and at a young age married my grandfather. Neither of them received higher education, my grandfather managed to return to high school as an adult but later had to drop out of his degree to support his family. Meanwhile, as a mother of three children, my grandmother worked multiple jobs, she cooked, cared for her family, and loved those around her. I admire her ability to weather adversity, many years later she would tell me: “You must fight for your happiness, fight to be happy.”My grandmother leaned into religion to find her strength, this was her source of hope and resilience, it was what enabled her to imagine brighter days during the darkest of times. And she fed her source with tremendous dedication every single day of her life. She became an active member of her religious community, learned, and taught everything she could, and treated those around her with the same love and compassion I still see in her.To this day, she faces a harsh recovery from her most recent back surgery. Her patience and positive attitude through this process are a testament to her spirit. On this Women’s Day, I want to give her a rose for everything she has done for my family, I wouldn’t be here without her.****Ma petite mamiePar Julie Bramond, Chargée de cours en français langue seconde, Langues et communication interculturelle, École d’éducation permanenteJe ne pourrais évoquer ma passion pour mon métier de professeure sans évoquer celle qui en est la cause : ma grand-mère. Ma grand-mère a passé sa vie – littéralement – à l’école, puisque, abandonnée dans un orphelinat à 3 ans et n’ayant jamais trouvé de famille, elle y demeura pour devenir, à sa majorité, éducatrice scolaire. Elle n’a pas eu une vie facile mais elle a toujours fait preuve de résilience, de joie et surtout d’un humour incroyable. Son amour pour mes frères et moi était infini et profond.Julie Bramond et sa grand-mèreElle m’a fait découvrir les mots et la langue au travers d’histoires qu’elle inventait et dont j’étais l’héroïne. Elle me racontait que les lettres du dictionnaire sortaient la nuit pour vivre de fantastiques aventures, car le jour, elles étaient prisonnières de leur définition. Dès lors, elle a fait naitre en moi cette passion indescriptible des mots et de leur transmission.Elle vous aurait d’ailleurs dit que j’ai appris à lire en la regardant jouer au Scrabble et, qu’à 3 ans, je lui demandais déjà : « mamie, est-ce que je peux jouer au petit crabe? », la prononciation de ce jeu étant encore bien difficile pour moi à cet âge.Elle ne m’aura, malheureusement, jamais vue devenir professeure de français, mais je sais qu’elle en aurait été particulièrement fière. Elle m’aurait traitée passionnément de « tricheuse » lors de nos parties de Scrabble, prétextant qu’avec mon métier, c’est normal de gagner.À chaque rentrée, je pense à elle, à tout l’amour qu’elle m’a donné mais surtout à cette magnifique passion qu’elle m’a insufflée.****My momBy Heidi Strohl, Digital Design Manager, Digital CommunicationsI grew up in the U.S., where access to healthcare is a privilege. In addition to being a nature lover, avid gardener, kid-costume seamstress, and delightful cook, my mom was a nurse – and she was everyone’s resource for health advice. One night, a neighbour of ours had an accident and came to the kitchen with his arm covered in blood. Mom fixed him up, and when his stitches were ready to come out, she took care of that too. By then, I knew my mom was pretty cool.When I was in high school, she went back to school to get her MBA. We graduated the same year, and she went on to become CEO of a health care group that serves un- and under-insured people in the area where I grew up. She and her team have opened multiple clinics and support health services in local schools, making access as easy as possible for folks who need it. They also organize and fund initiatives that support overall health – like mental health services and delivering healthier food options to low-income families – to prevent common health issues before they need to be treated. Mom is one of those rare people who can sustain an incredible vision (and a smile) while attending to the five million fiddly details needed to get the job done. I’m so proud of her!****Gwendolyn MingsBy Shondra Mings, Equity Education Advisor, Anti-Oppression and Anti-Racism EducationGwendolyn MingsIt’s hard to fathom someone you’ve never met being such an inspiration, but Gwendolyn Mings name and face is one that I’ve had etched in my memory since I was a small child. I’d see pictures of her and be reminded of the women around me that I loved and adored. She left this earth too soon to see her own babies grow up let alone meet her grandchildren, but she has never been forgotten and her spirit lives on.Gwendolyn Mings was my grandmother who had a deep love for her family, a passion for music, for helping those in her community and was a nurse that cared for many. She lived a simple life that focused on the things she loved best, her family and God. While she came from humble beginnings, she instilled such strong values in her children and I feel like I in some ways have been able to know her through her daughter, my mother Karen Mings who stands as a testament to her love, kindness and generosity. Her life and spirit will forever be an inspiration to me and a constant reminder to focus on the simple things that make life bright and beautiful.****The U.S. women’s soccer teamBy Stephanie Wereley, Communications Officer, University AdvancementAs a soccer fan, I was very excited by the recent success of the U.S. women’s soccer team in their legal battle for equal pay! I saw them play a semi-final game in Montreal’s Olympic Stadium back in 2015 – they went on to earn their third FIFA World Cup title – and I followed their financial discrimination lawsuit. I was happy to see them not only win their case late last month, but to earn broad media coverage while doing it. I hope more national and international sports associations take note.****Niloufar BayaniBy Ingrid Birker, Redpath Museum Public Education ProgramThis year I really want to highlight a former McGill student named Niloufar Bayani. Before her graduation in 2009 she was involved with several summer internships and courses at the Redpath Museum. For instance, attached photo shows the back of her head while excavating the Triceratops skull as part of the McGill Vertebrate Paleontology Field Course in 2005. In the summer of 2008 she worked as a research assistant on invasive species in the St. Lawrence river with McGill biologist Anthony Ricciardi.She was arrested by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards in February 2019 with eight other environmental activists tracking the endangered Asiatic cheetah. She is still in Evan prison and could face the death penalty.I have not been able to find any recent updates but here is her wiki page.I did not really know Niloufar but I feel her impact daily. This photo of the back of her head (above) was something I saw daily. It just shows me how precious life is and how suddenly it can change.I feel like she is OK, and I certainly hope so, and I believe in the essence of hope, as Jane Goodall says in her 2021 book: “People tend to think that it is simply passive wishful thinking: I hope something will happen but I’m not going to do anything about it,” she notes. “This is indeed the opposite of real hope, which requires action and engagement. Many people understand the dire state of the planet – but do nothing about it because they feel helpless and hopeless.”She adds that achieving a lasting sense of hope requires four components: attainable goals, realistic pathways to pursue them, confidence that we will succeed, and confidence that others support us. Goodall emphasizes that hope is a survival trait that every child possesses****My mom, JuttaBy Laura Reumont, U1 physicsFew people I admire as much as I do my mom. I seriously cannot imagine showing the courage she did when she was my age. She left the home she grew up in all her life to find freedom in a country much farther away, with basically no support. She pursued a job that turned her into a globe-trotter and in doing so gifted me an incredible childhood travelling the world. Much of who I am — the education I’ve received, my values, my strength of character — I owe to my mom. I love her so much and will look up to her always!Jutta","Tue, 03/08/2022 - 12:54"
Virtual training to support Ukrainian healthcare workers,"Dr. Ruqaiya Al Shehhi and Dr. Dan Deckelbaum demonstrate lifesaving procedures while Dr. Junko Tokuno films.When trauma surgeon Dr. Dan Deckelbaum was contacted by colleagues in Ukraine and asked to provide teaching materials in an effort to respond to urgent healthcare needs, he quickly jumped into action.As Co-Director for the Centre for Global Surgery (CGS) at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC), and Surgical and Procedural Skills Director at McGill’s Steinberg Centre for Simulation and Interactive Learning (SCSIL), Dr. Deckelbaum was well-equipped to bring these two teams together to quickly create a multimedia education program for immediate use in Ukraine.“The CGS has been collaborating with Ukraine for the past decade on trauma research and training initiatives. At the time, we never imagined that they would be in this situation. To support their healthcare teams, our partners requested teaching materials for basic life support and lifesaving procedures that can be done by non-surgeons,” explains Dr. Deckelbaum.Dr. Deckelbaum worked with Dr. Ruqaiya Al Shehhi, a fellow in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery at McGill University from Oman, and with Dr. Junko Tokuno, a thoracic surgeon from Kyoto, Japan who is currently the Satoko and Richard Ingram McGill Surgical Education Scholar. Together, they created videos to demonstrate how to perform a number of lifesaving surgical procedures including cricothyroidotomy, chest tube insertion and airway ventilatory management. These videos were recorded in the simulated operating room at the SCSIL and edited by Dr. Tokuno, with added Ukrainian narration.Coming together quickly to make a differenceProfessor Tamara Carver, Director of the McGill Office of Ed-TECH (Education Technology and E-learning Collaboration for Health) for the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the SCSIL, and her team have been collaborating with Dr. Deckelbaum at the CGS and the MUHC to develop free and open education programs that convey appropriate management of trauma, including disaster response, and that emphasize a multidisciplinary approach in managing trauma patients. The Trauma and Disaster Team Response© (TDTR©) course will be available soon on the McGill platform and is geared towards a wide range of healthcare professionals in low- and middle-income countries.For the past six months, Dr. Tokuno has been working closely with her co-supervisors, Professor Carver and Dr. Gerald Fried, to develop training modules; this mentorship has given her the skills needed to create and edit these videos so quickly. “When this request came in, the team at the SCSIL were ready within less than an hour.  We had the team, the know-how, and the equipment at our fingertips.  The power to train students, like Dr. Tokuno, who can then train others to do this is truly amazing and builds capacity. It’s brilliant to witness,” says Professor Carver.“From the time of request for this educational content to creation, it took less than three hours, and the final product was delivered in less than 24 hours. I am very impressed with how quickly our teams came together to produce such excellent results,” expressed Dr. Gerald Fried, Director of the SCSIL and Associate Dean of Education Technology and Innovation at the McGill Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.","Fri, 03/04/2022 - 13:53"
Sustainable Sparks: Paul Meldrum on growing food for the future,"“Make sure you have your eyes open to the world around you, and that you’re constantly asking yourself, ‘How can I act in ways that are sustainable – not just for me – but for generations to come?'” says Paul MeldrumSiddhi AubeeluckPaul Meldrum is no doubt a busy man. From establishing a dairy farm from the ground up to working as an agricultural journalist with CBC and CTV, he has been involved in both telling the stories and improving the mechanics of our food systems. As the current General Manager of the Macdonald Campus Farm, Meldrum’s diverse farm-centered life skills have been integral to sustainability initiatives at Mac Campus and beyond, including McGill Feeding McGill, the Macdonald Student-run Ecological Gardens (MSEG), and dozens of Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) initiatives. McGill’s SPF is the largest fund of its kind in Canada with a mandate to build a culture of sustainability on McGill campuses through the development and seed-funding of interdisciplinary projects. During a sit-down with the Office of Sustainability, Meldrum shares the challenges and triumphs in running a university farm, and his take on the future of sustainable food. Why do you think that having the farm as a part of a learning institution is important for students?McGill is [one of the few] universities in Canada that has a farm right on campus. Other universities have farms, but the Mac farm is so close that students can walk directly from campus or take the bus from downtown right to the fields. This allows for a unique hands-on experience and the opportunity for part-time jobs working at the Horticulture Centre and in the Dairy.Having the farm as a learning space helps students bridge the gap between idealism and reality. To be able to see what the farm can logistically do really helps ground big ideas and make them doable. That’s not to say you can’t constantly improve – you can, and you should. It’s a place for students to get to put the theory they’re learning into practice.  They get to learn in a new way and ask different questions that might not come up unless you’re right there. I think it’s an educational laboratory that you just cannot replicate in a classroom.A few months ago, we spoke to former Executive Chef Oliver De Volpi about McGill Feeding McGill from the kitchen’s end, but what is it like from the perspective of the farm? McGill has a farm that produces very high-quality food, so why wouldn’t we feed our students what we produce? We could ship fresh produce to a central warehouse and then a distributor only to be trucked back to campus, or we could take it straight from the farm to our plates. It just makes sense, for the environment and for our community.Knowing who produces your food and trying to cut down the amount of transportation on food isn’t always possible – the sheer volume of food needed to feed large metropolitan areas does not always allow for this. But there are opportunities to market directly to our customers, such as what we are doing with McGill Feeding McGill and what MSEG is doing with their student-run market garden. If we can provide fresh food at a competitive price and reduce the cost and effect of transportation and storage, why wouldn’t we do it?And for us, knowing that what we are producing is being eaten by our students and being appreciated adds so much pride to our work as farmers. I have always been very cognizant of the fact that what I’m producing is going to go into someone’s body, so we are extremely scrupulous about the quality of the vegetables, eggs, milk, and meat that we produce on the Macdonald Campus Farm.You have transformed the farm from not only a place to learn, but a crucial part of McGill’s sustainability community. Why has this been a priority for you?The SPF was started by [students], and I don’t think any of us really realized how big it would become at the time. It was the beginning of opportunities for change that just weren’t possible before.For me, sustainability is two-fold; first, making sure our resources are going to be there forever. I believe you need to leave the world a better place than you found it and to treat your environment with respect, because it’s up to us to make sure that it’s there for the future.  But the second part of this is that is has to be economically sustainable. If farmers don’t get enough return from the sale of their produce to pay for sustainable methods, they can’t stay in business.I’ve been very fortunate to have some incredibly bright, forward-thinking ideas come to the farm. And why wouldn’t I support that? If we can do it and it’s going to make our campus better, it’s going to make our world better. If it’s going to provide learning opportunities for students, if it’s going to improve our natural environment, then it’s a no-brainer for me.Of course, it is extra work, it means more hours but I’m a farmer, so I am used to working lots of hours. If it is worthwhile and it is successful, you can’t put a dollar value on the satisfaction you get from that. I’m very fortunate that I’m in a position where I can support this as the manager.Sustainability is an important part of what I believe in on the farm, and it is important in the teaching that happens here as well.What are some challenges that you believe lie ahead for agriculture in general?One of the challenges I think we’re facing on a broader scale is how removed people have become from where their food comes from.We have high-quality food in abundance. We never go without. But when you’re growing it, you’ve got the challenge of weather, pests, weeds, markets. You need to know proper techniques for soil fertility, choose the right varieties, and crop rotations. None of us think about these things when we go to the grocery store. This can make it easier for people to start criticizing how food is produced and not understand the point of view of the farmers.That’s why I think the new engagement centre we are building at Mac is so exciting and so important. We’ll be able to bring kids in and show them where their food comes from; they’ll be able to take vegetables from the ground and see before their eyes how they are transformed into a meal, and they will see first-hand how milk comes from a cow and not a carton! This can help build that connection so many of us are missing.What do you want the McGill community to know about the future of sustainability and agriculture?The two are compatible and not mutually exclusive. That means we have to make sure that when we do demand more sustainable practices in agriculture, we don’t make it impossible for the farmers to adopt those practices. We need good dialogue and an intelligent level of understanding of what it takes to produce food. Changes need to be implemented in a fashion where that is still possible. There are a lot of things we can live without, but food is not one of them, so it needs to be a priority.The other thing I want to say is that most of us are just average people living average lives. But within those average lives, we have opportunities to make significant differences a little bit at a time. We just have to do the small things that will make our world a better place for future generations.I guess that’s what sustainability is all about: Make sure you have your eyes open to the world around you, and that you’re constantly asking yourself, “How can I act in ways that are sustainable – not just for me – but for generations to come?”","Fri, 03/04/2022 - 08:15"
McGill students earn Pathy Fellowships for community-based initiatives,"McGill 2022-2023 Pathy Foundation Fellows (r to l): Félix Aupalu, Attou Mamat, and Jackie Stendel Earlier today, a trio of graduating McGill students were recognized for their strong ties with the community, earning three of seven Pathy Foundation Fellowships for 2022-2023.The 12-month Fellowship provides community-focused experiential learning opportunities for graduating students of Bishop’s University, McGill University, Queen’s University, University of Ottawa and St. Francis Xavier University. Applicants submit a self-designed initiative proposal to work with a community with which they have a connection, to foster sustainable positive social change in Canada and around the world. The Pathy Family Foundation supports each Fellow with funding of up to $40,000.The incoming Fellows will attend skill-building sessions and planning workshops at Coady Institute before commencing the nine-month community phase.Here are McGill’s 2022-2023 Pathy Foundation Fellows and their descriptions of their respective projects:Félix AupaluCommunity: Inuit people of the Canadian Arctic (Puvirnituq, Nunavik, Québec), MontrealInitiative Synopsis: Inuit Youth Collaborating for a Bright Future“I want to host small events and gatherings (online and in-person) that allow Inuit youth to share and discuss important topics and subjects; my initiative will aim to create spaces that encourage togetherness, celebrates excellence, and contributes to our vision of our future,” says Aupalu. “By creating these spaces for Inuit youth, this project will address our community’s ability to feel heard, collaborate on solutions, heal through community, and share stories of success. The gatherings will be both formal and informal in a way, and will be informed both by traditional and contemporary methods of community building.”Attou MamatCommunity: Montreal Steppers, MontrealInitiative Synopsis: Practicing Transformative Justice Through Art“My initiative is a participatory art-based workshop program to introduce young Tioh;tia:ke/Montreal students to the feminist, anti-racist, and anti-oppressive principles of transformative justice,” says Mamat. “Although schools would serve as entry points for this program, my hope is for the project to be expanded to other community spaces where youths gather. Through poetry, dance, visual arts, and more, this project would help young people in Tioh;tia:ke/Montreal, with particular attention given to Black, Indigenous, and other racialized youths, develop the tools they need to provide care to each other and their communities.”Jackie Stendel Community: At-risk youth, LOVE, MontrealInitiative Synopsis: Art and Environmental Belonging with At-Risk Youth“My initiative is to introduce a program that explores social and environmental sustainability with at-risk youth through transformative social engagement,” says Stendel. “The program will engage youth by looking at the multifaceted nature of the climate crisis, possibilities to form reciprocal and grateful relationships with nature and methods of fighting for sustainability with art-creation methods. Through art-making and leadership activities, youth will find personal connections to environmental issues, form relationships to local ecologies, develop meaningful communities and work as a leader to inspire others.”Read the Pathy Foundation announcement.","Tue, 03/01/2022 - 13:42"
Undergrad team uses machine learning to create a better hospital ventilator,"A team of McGill undergraduates recently won top honours at the University of Toronto’s Project X global undergraduate research competition – an annual event that challenges students around the world to use machine learning to address pressing health issues.The group won the Clinical Practice category for its DeepVent software that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize and personalize hospital ventilation treatments.“RL models can learn from the past and can predict how the present will affect the future,” says team leader Flemming Kondrup, a U4 Honours student in Anatomy and Cell Biology. “This means that DeepVent can adapt to each patient by analyzing how they responded to previous treatments, and predict how the patient will react to future ones.”DeepVent can adjust settings such as air pressure, the volume of air, and the concentration of oxygen in that air. Doctors usually have to manually adjust these settings as a patient’s condition evolves, a costly, complex, and often difficult task.“We find that DeepVent is expected to not only perform similarly to physicians, but actually outperform them by 59%,” Kondrup says.McGill’s Artificial Intelligence Society helped create Kondrup’s team last September for the competition. Kondrup’s teammates include two students in Statistics and Computer Science, Elaine Lau and Mia Tran; two students in Mathematics and Computer Science, Thomas Jiralerspong and Nathan de Lara; and Jacob Shkrob, who’s studying Probability and Statistics.More than 150 students from 25 North American universities took part in the five-month competition, which culminated in the awards ceremony on Feb. 18-19.Pandemic provided inspirationSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for ventilators in hospital intensive care units increased dramatically. The increased use of the devices, and the strain they place on the medical staff tasked with monitoring them constantly, provided part of the inspiration for Kondrup and his team.“An important challenge we’re seeing during this pandemic is the pressure that is put on intensive care units and its healthcare workers,” Kondrup says. “This means that doctors or nurses don’t always have the time to check on every patient’s ventilator settings, leading to sub-optimal care. Our work would  not only improve care, but also potentially automate ventilation. DeepVent could take over the role of adjusting the settings, saving essential time for doctors and nurses to focus on other tasks.”The team has not yet come up with a plan to have DeepVent approved for hospital use, though Kondrup and his team have heard from some potential sponsors.“The process to implement this type of technology is quite rigorous, and rightfully so,” Kondrup says. “We’re talking about the lives of patients, and that means that we need to assure high reliability and safety. This first requires the technology to get approved, and then years of clinical trials to eventually be used in clinics. We believe our work is an important stepping stone in that direction. We focus a lot on assuring safety for patients, and show that DeepVent makes recommendations within safe ranges, similar to the ones of an experienced doctor.”The five months of hard work has landed the group a $25,000 prize.“We haven’t yet addressed what the prize money would be used for, but supporting further works is definitely an option. I know a few people on the team are also considering going to graduate school to gain more knowledge in the field. This support could also definitely help make that possible.”","Tue, 03/01/2022 - 13:28"
A leap forward for rare disease,"By definition, a rare disease affects only a small number of people. Its scarcity means that affected individuals are left looking for equally rare resources: research and expertise can be hard to find and scattered across the country. Treatments that could help slow the progression of symptoms are limited and health care teams tend to focus on managing symptoms that affect day-to-day life.But while the diseases may be rare, the collective burden of illness is not. According to the Canadian Organization for Rare Disease (CORD), one in 12 Canadians has a rare disorder. Those 3 million individuals and their families face a debilitating prognosis that severely impacts their future. And among these rare conditions are neurological diseases, many of which are more common in Canada than elsewhere in the world.Making rare disease treatableOne of the challenges with rare diseases is that little may be known about the mechanisms causing the condition. In addition, biomarkers may not yet have been identified to help facilitate early diagnosis and the prediction of clinical outcomes. As a result, clinical research is left to explore different potential pathways of action in the hopes of finding one that yields the most impact.“If we look at cancer treatments, it took several decades to understand the mechanisms of the disease. A lot of research went into developing a new generation of drugs that have transformed the field of cancer treatment dramatically. And we are finally seeing the same success in treating rare neuromuscular diseases,” explains Dr. Angela Genge, the executive director of the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital).The CRU’s mission is to make all neurological and rare diseases treatable. Neuromuscular diseases in particular represent almost 20 per cent of all clinical trials at the CRU, one of the largest neurological research centres in Canada which conducts over 110 clinical trials each year. A large roster of trials enables patients to have access to investigational treatments while they are in development, often when no other treatment exists for their disease.Neuromuscular focusAn area of focus among those neuromuscular trials has been better treatment options for myasthenia gravis (MG), a debilitating disease that leads to a loss of muscle function and severe weakness. In myasthenia gravis, an abnormal autoimmune response results in a decreased number of acetylcholine receptors. This in turn causes failed nerve transmission at certain neuromuscular junctions – that is, at the connection between nerve cells and the muscles they control. The damage eventually means that the brain and muscles can no longer communicate, causing loss of muscle function and severe weakness.Individuals with myasthenia gravis may start with mild symptoms such as slurred speech, droopy eyelids, double vision and lack of balance, and progress to more severe symptoms such as choking, extreme fatigue and even episodes of respiratory failure. It can occur at any age, but most commonly begins for women before 40 and for men after the age 60.A shift in treatmentSome individuals with myasthenia gravis do not respond well to available treatments, which usually involve the long-term suppression of the immune system. Until 2017, there had been no new drug to treat the disease in almost 60 years.Dr. Angela Genge, Executive Director of the Clinical Research Unit at The Neuro“This rare disease is difficult to diagnose and has been treated by general immunosuppressant therapy for decades. Finally, over the course of the last two years, we have a number of new therapies that are far more precise in their treatment of myasthenia gravis. This marks a real shift in treatment options,” says Dr. Genge.The CRU has been involved in a range of clinical trials for myasthenia gravis, studying treatments that target specific aspects of the immune response. One such pathway focusses on the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The treatment blocks the receptor, in turn reducing the harmful acetylcholine antibodies that cause myasthenia gravis symptoms. Both Vyvgart (efgartigimod), which received FDA approval at the end of 2021, and rozanolixizumab which posted positive Phase III results, use this approach.Another avenue that has proved promising has focussed on inhibiting the complement cascade, a group of proteins that are involved in activating the immune cells that produce antibodies. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. Two drugs studied at the CRU use this pathway: Ultomiris (ravulizumab) which has been approved by the FDA; and zilucoplan which posted positive results of its Phase III trial and will be submitted for regulatory submission later this year.“Finally, rare diseases are getting the attention they need from biotechs as well as pharmaceutical companies. These new options will substantially decrease the burden of the treatment on patients while allowing those who were previously only getting moderate benefit from the old therapy to have much more substantial improvement in their disease management to the point of having minimal symptoms,” concludes Dr. Genge.Get more information on Myasthenia Gravis and other neuromuscular disease clinical trials on the CRU website. ****Un bond en avant pour les maladies raresDes traitements ciblés pour la myasthénie grave offrent enfin de nouvelles options aux personnes atteintes de cette maladie neuromusculairePar définition, une maladie rare ne touche qu’un petit nombre de personnes. Sa rareté signifie que les personnes qui en sont atteinte se retrouvent en quête de ressources tout aussi rares : l’expertise et la peuvent être difficiles à trouver et dispersées à travers le pays. Les traitements qui pourraient aider à ralentir la progression des symptômes sont limités; les équipes de soins de santé ont tendance à se concentrer sur la gestion des symptômes qui affectent la vie quotidienne.Mais alors que ces conditions peuvent être rares, le fardeau collectif de la maladie ne l’est pas. Selon l’Organisation canadienne des maladies rares (CORD), un Canadien sur 12 souffre d’une maladie rare. Ces 3 millions de personnes et leurs familles font face à un pronostic débilitant qui a de graves répercussions sur leur avenir. Et parmi ces maladies rares, on compte les maladies neurologiques, dont plusieurs sont plus courantes au Canada qu’ailleurs dans le monde.Rendre les maladies rares traitablesL’un des défis des maladies rares est que l’on en sait peu sur les mécanismes à l’origine de la maladie. De plus, les biomarqueurs pertinents n’ont peut-être pas encore été identifiés pour aider à faciliter le diagnostic précoce et la prédiction des résultats cliniques. En conséquence, la recherche clinique doit explorer différentes voies d’action potentielles dans l’espoir de trouver celle qui a le plus d’impact.« Si on regarde les traitements contre le cancer, il a fallu plusieurs décennies pour comprendre les mécanismes de la maladie. De nombreuses recherches ont été consacrées au développement d’une nouvelle génération de médicaments qui ont radicalement transformé le domaine du traitement du cancer. Et nous constatons enfin le même succès dans le traitement des maladies neuromusculaires rares », explique la Dre Angela Genge, directrice exécutive de l’Unité de recherche clinique (URC) du Neuro (Institut-Hôpital neurologique de Montréal).La mission de l’URC est de rendre toutes les maladies neurologiques et rares traitables. Les maladies neuromusculaires représentent près de 20 % de tous les essais cliniques à l’URC — l’un des plus grands centres de recherche en neurologie au Canada qui mène plus de 110 essais cliniques chaque année. Une large liste d’essais permet aux patients d’avoir accès à des traitements expérimentaux pendant leur développement, souvent lorsqu’il n’existe aucun autre traitement pour gérer leur maladie.Spécialisation neuromusculaireUn domaine d’intérêt important pour l’URC a été de trouver de meilleures options de traitement pour la myasthénie grave (MG), une maladie neuromusculaire auto-immune débilitante qui entraîne une perte de la fonction musculaire et une faiblesse importante. Dans la myasthénie grave, une réponse auto-immune anormale entraîne une diminution du nombre de récepteurs de l’acétylcholine. Cela provoque à son tour une défaillance de la transmission nerveuse au niveau de certaines jonctions neuromusculaires, c’est-à-dire au niveau de la connexion entre les cellules nerveuses et les muscles qu’elles contrôlent. En bout de ligne, le cerveau et les muscles ne peuvent plus communiquer, entraînant une perte de fonction musculaire et une grave faiblesse.Les personnes atteintes de myasthénie grave peuvent d’abord ressentir des symptômes légers tels que des troubles de l’élocution, des paupières tombantes, une vision double et un manque d’équilibre, et évoluer vers des symptômes plus graves tels que l’étouffement, une fatigue extrême et même des épisodes d’insuffisance respiratoire. La maladie peut survenir à tout âge, mais débute le plus souvent chez les femmes avant 40 ans et chez les hommes après 60 ans.Changement d’orientation dans les traitementsCertaines personnes atteintes de myasthénie grave ne répondent pas bien aux traitements disponibles, qui impliquent généralement la suppression à long terme du système immunitaire. Jusqu’en 2017, il n’y avait eu aucun nouveau médicament pour traiter la maladie en près de 60 ans.“Cette maladie rare est difficile à diagnostiquer et est traitée depuis des décennies par une thérapie immunosuppressive générale. Enfin, au cours des deux dernières années, nous avons un certain nombre de nouvelles thérapies beaucoup plus précises. Cela marque un véritable changement dans les options de traitement », déclare la Dre Genge.L’URC a participé à une série d’essais cliniques sur la myasthénie grave, étudiant des traitements ciblant des aspects spécifiques de la réponse immunitaire. L’une de ces voies se concentre sur le récepteur néonatal Fc (FcRn). Le traitement bloque ce récepteur, réduisant à son tour les anticorps nocifs de l’acétylcholine qui provoquent les symptômes de la myasthénie grave. Le Vyvgart (efgartigimod), qui a reçu l’approbation de la FDA fin 2021, et le rozanolixizumab qui a affiché des résultats positifs de phase III, utilisent cette approche.Une autre voie qui s’est révélée prometteuse s’est concentrée sur l’inhibition de la cascade du complément, un groupe de protéines impliquées dans l’activation des cellules immunitaires productrices d’anticorps. Lorsqu’elle est activée de manière incontrôlée, la cascade du complément répond de manière démesurée, conduisant le corps à attaquer ses propres cellules saines. Deux médicaments étudiés à l’URC utilisent cette voie : l’Ultomiris (ravulizumab) qui a été approuvé par la FDA ; et le zilucoplan qui a publié des résultats positifs de son essai de phase III et sera envoyé pour soumission réglementaire plus tard cette année.« Enfin, les maladies rares reçoivent l’attention dont elles ont besoin de la part des sociétés biotechnologiques et pharmaceutiques. Ces nouvelles options réduiront considérablement le fardeau du traitement pour les patients, tout en permettant à ceux qui ne tiraient auparavant que des avantages modérés de l’ancienne thérapie d’avoir une amélioration beaucoup plus substantielle de la gestion de leur maladie au point d’avoir des symptômes minimes », conclut la Dre Genge.Pour la liste des essais cliniques en cours à l’URC sur la myasthénie grave et d’autres maladies neuromusculaires, visitez : cru.mcgill.ca/fr/nm-2.","Mon, 02/28/2022 - 23:03"

"Emmanuel Tabi on fighting oppression, honouring diverse voices and fostering a courageous classroom","Emmanuel Tabi is a happy man and it shows. His smile frequently lights up the recent 45-minute Teams interview with the McGill Reporter – not an easy task given the impersonal, often dreary, nature of online interaction.  “I’m really excited and I can’t hide it,” Tabi says – with a huge smile, of course.Emmanuel Tabi is an assistant professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in EducationShane Parent Tabi has every reason to be happy. He started at McGill last fall as an assistant professor in Black/African Studies in Education in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education (DISE). He is part of McGill’s recent cluster hire of Black tenure-track professors – one of the Action Items in the University’s Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism. “I feel really honoured, and it’s such a privilege to be here. If you told me when I started my PhD journey that I would end up being a tenure-track faculty member at McGill doing Black studies in education, I might have fainted,” he laughs. “I never want this feeling to go away.”Moving from the GTA, Tabi, his wife and their two young sons have settled in nicely, quickly making friends with their neighbours and enjoying the “great parks,” “nice walks” and the nearby daycare. “When we started dating, we were talking about different places in Canada where we’d like to live and Montreal was on top of the list,” says Tabi. “And now, here we are.”Read the interview below.Can you give us a bit of your background?My PHD is from OISE/University of Toronto, and my post-doc is from University of Windsor. I was working for the Peel District School Board and also doing consultant work with the York Region District School Board, specifically around anti-black racism within the arts.What was your reaction when McGill hired you?Oh man, I still smile. I don’t want this feeling to go anywhere.It’s a really special time. My mom died back in 2015 and I wish she was alive to experience this,  just to say thank you for all she did for me… For her to come from the small island of Grenada and raise a Black kid in Canada isn’t easy … And the way she stood up for me and advocated for me… And, now, for her son to be a professor of education at an institution like McGill, it’s really incredible.And, I’ve been really embraced within the [DISE] department. I feel at home.How have you settled into to Montreal?It’s such a huge opportunity to be in Montreal – especially with all its Black history and the Black communities that are here, and that have been here. Just to continue learning about their histories and stories.One of my heroes is Oscar Peterson – Oscar Emmanuel Peterson [laughing].I am a classical pianist, and I was taught through the Royal Conservatory, though I am out of practice a bit. When I was a kid, my mom would buy me Oscar Peterson videos and get cassettes from the library to motivate me…he’s one of the greatest pianists of all time. But also having a Black Canadian like him [as a role model] was very important for me. Haydain Neale from Jacksoul was also important for me.Tell us about your primary areas of interest in your research.My research has been pretty broad.In my postdoc I looked at Black youth in the Windsor-Detroit-Toronto area and their educational trajectories. I was also a Co-chair of the African Diaspora Youth conference with Dr. Andrew Allen.My dissertation work looked at how Black activists used their cultural production, specifically spoken word and rapping, in their community education work and in their activism.I also focus on issues of anti-oppression, anti-patriarchy, anti-racism, and anti-homophobia.You also address issues of underrepresented people within underrepresented groups.When we say ‘Blackness,’ it’s not a monolithic experience. In Toronto, I worked on many projects with Dr. Lance McCready, particularly the Educational Trajectories of Black Young Men Project in which we conducted focus groups with community organizations such as Black CAP (Black Coalition for AIDS Prevention).  With these focus groups, we spoke to gender-nonconforming, queer, gay Black youths. Their experiences are different than other Black youth, right?It is important that we draw from Kimberlé Crenshaw’s notion of Intersectionality, and understanding how gender, class, ableism, citizenship, and other social and political factors and realities intersect with race and how our identities and perceptions are shaped and framed through these social constructs. So, instead of saying ‘all Black youth go through this…,’ we have to make sure we speak to the many different lives, identities and realities that Black folks experience.That’s why this work is important, because there are many different lived experiences. You can’t look at a demographic and say ‘this is the definitive experience,’ we have to centre our stories.We have to make sure as many voices as possible are represented, within our research, within our conversation, and within our classrooms. This is paramount for me.What is the difference between equity and equality?Equality is ‘I’m going to buy you the exact same shoes that I have so we can be equal.’ But equity is more about responding to the specific needs of an individual, a family and a community. What type of shoes do you need?  What is your shoe size? You might not even want shoes!In understanding equity, we have to understand history and how we got here.For example, in working with Indigenous communities, we have to understand that their needs [are linked] to a very particular history, a history of colonization, a history of genocide.We can’t lump together all people who are not white, say this is what they need. The experiences are so different.How do we gain this understanding?Conversation is critical. Narrative inquiry is critical. Centering the lived experiences and the voices of racialized people is such an important part of it.In order to be truly equitable, we need to hear these voices tell us what the issues are, as opposed to questioning them.I’ve been asked many times over the past few years ‘What can we do for Black people?’The first thing I say is ‘Believe them.’Often, I talk to people that I’ve never met before. But we’ve had similar experiences, particularly within the education system. We have similar bodies in the same system. The outcomes can be so similar.It’s not a conspiracy. [Black people] don’t sit down and plan what we’re going to say to make people feel sorry for us.Believe us, that’s part of equity. Know the histories and how we came to a place. Black history and Black realities predate slavery.McGill is hiring more Black tenure-track professors. What do initiatives like this mean for McGill and other institutions? Yes, it’s important, but it’s not only about hiring Black folks, right? Its about others also doing the anti-racist work as well. And when hiring Black folks, there needs to be a diverse pool of Black folks; Black women, Black queer folks, Black trans folks.  It’s constantly moving against that idea, that Blackness is a monolith.Cluster hires are important [for several reasons]. First, we are able to support one another as we begin this journey. As well, representation is important.I loved playing hockey growing up and it’s still my favorite sport. But I was always told that there are no Black people in hockey. It hit me, even though I knew of Willy O’Ree and other Black hockey players. That’s why Jerome Iginla was huge for me.The other day I was picking my son up from daycare and there was a Black kid walking up the street with his hockey bag and skates. I wonder how much of an influence P.K. Subban had on that boy? Because it’s not only about us as Black people, but it’s also about the communities we’re entering. Does that community see us as being part it?If representation is important to Black students, what does a more diverse faculty mean for white students?I’d be interested to know how many of my students had a Black educator before me.I’ve seen it in the classroom before. It took some students time to process what they were seeing. ‘OK, he’s Black, he’s my professor, and he’s smart.’ That’s a lot of adjectives that they don’t often associate with Blackness, right before their eyes.I had one student who came to see me after class and he said ‘I’m racist but I don’t want to be. My family is racist, my small-town community is racist… but I don’t want to be.’ And he came to every single one of my office hours and we talked for a whole semester. We just sat down and we talked.That came from a class in which we were talking about Philando Castile, who was murdered in front of his wife and daughter. I was really upset because I was recently married and I felt that could have been me.In previous classes, this student was always sitting with his arms were folded. He didn’t really want listen. But after that class he came to me and he said he had watched the video while I was talking. ‘That was wrong,’ he said. ‘I want talk about this.’The reality, though, is its exhausting. Even though as an educator it’s important, as a Black person, speaking to the things that have traumatized me and have traumatized others take an extra level of energy and focus.It sounds like a pretty challenging atmosphere at timesIt can be. But challenge is important if we want to learn.The readings in my classes are often pieces that have challenged me, they challenge my understanding of pedagogy, literacy, teaching and education. Challenge – not comfort – leads to growth, and I really enjoy being part of our students growth.Being challenged is important, but being challenged in a kind, caring and also courageous way. Nelson Mandela tells us that courage is not the absence of fear, its triumph over fear, right?And then I ask myself what does a courageous classroom look like? Both for me and for my students? And how do we level these hierarchies and have conversations – especially when we’re doing equity work, because we’re all coming in with very particular political views.So, conversation is important in your classroom? Absolutely. The way we respond to one another’s journals and such – the things we agree with and the things we disagree with. How can we continue to be kind within those discussions?  We’re evolving beings, and it’s important to think of education as transformational as opposed to a final destination.Is the classroom still transformational for you? Always. It is an exchange that we have with our students, an exchange we have with our faculty. It’s a constant exchange and you grow through those exchanges.I’m a Canadian but being here in Quebec is a different context. I’m excited to continue to learn about this particular context and growing my understanding. It helps me better understand my students and where they are coming from.All the courses I’ve ever taught I begin with Linda Christensen’s idea around the Where I’m From poems.We do that in our first class, and people have the option to share or not share. But everyone gets to hear the different voices.You hear where people are from – not only geographically – we learn about different cultures and values. That’s where the dialogue starts.I get to know my students. Instead of imposing a curriculum on them, we now ask ‘how does this curriculum speak to who you are as a person, who you’re transforming into, and who you want to be?’It’s exciting.

Decolonization is not a metaphor,"The February panel included Dr. Saleem Razak, Terri Givens, Jean Saint-Vil (moderator) and Jamilah Dei-SharpeOn Thursday, February 17, a virtual panel was convened on decolonizing research – a topic that is connected to broad efforts related to decolonization at McGill through commitments set out in the 2020 Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism (AP-ABR). Three panelists including McGill professor and the Provost’s Academic Lead and Advisor on AP-ABR, Terri Givens, discussed meaningful approaches to co-creating knowledge beneficial to racialized communities.Givens was joined by moderator Jean Saint-Vil, Special Advisor to the Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation; Dr. Saleem Razak, professor of Pediatrics and Health Sciences Education at McGill, as well as the Director of the Pediatric Critical Care Unit at the Montreal Children’s Hospital, and Director of McGill’s Office of Social Accountability and Community Engagement; and, Jamilah Dei-Sharpe, an emerging sociologist completing her Ph.D. of Social and Cultural Analysis at Concordia University, specializing in decolonial pedagogy, Black masculinity studies, Black Canadian studies, popular music studies and anti-racist education.Saint-Vil opened the panel cautioning that, “an hour and a half will only allow us to start the conversation for all that needs to be covered.” Despite the time limitation, the panel explored many topics of importance to the McGill community in its efforts to decolonize research on campus and to contribute to decolonizing efforts in Canada and abroad.The honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Housing, Diversity, and Inclusion, delivered opening remarks. “Black Canadian history is Canadian history,” he said. “The story and the contributions and the excellence of Black Canadian communities cannot be captured by a single month.” Minister Hussen reflected on his family history in the context of decolonizing research. “As someone who was born in Africa, my parents and grandparents went through the colonial experience and they went through the liberation process as well,” he said. “They educated us on the destruction, both physical and otherwise, that colonization did to the people subjected to it. In terms of liberation, it is important to decolonize our minds and the parameters of the research conducted.”Examining the ecosystem of knowledgeSaint-Vil kick-started the discussion with the question, “while the foundation of some disciplines is Eurocentric, how do we shift the narrative?Razak employed the ecosystem analogy to highlight the importance of co-created knowledge systems, arguing that research institutions around the world are imbued with strengths and can take approaches to knowledge generation that will differ from the approaches currently championed by McGill.Razak also pointed to the fact that North-South research collaborations are currently plagued by inequities.  “One of the things for us to think about at McGill University is that there is an inherent, almost 100 per cent risk when we develop North-South relationships with other universities that the relationship will be exploitative”, he said. He pointed out that while many McGill students benefit from field semesters at the McGill Bellairs Research Institute, located in Holetown Barbados, the benefits of this research activity to Barbadians are unclear.Razak offered a model to address these inequities: The North-South-South tripartite research collaboration. UNESCO describes this triangular model as, “two or more developing countries collaborating with a third developed country which contributes knowledge, technology and resources.” Saint-Vil described the concrete actions McGill is taking to explore this model through a working group. This working group, comprised of members of the Anti-Black Racism Action Plan team, the Bellairs Research Institute, and Black students’ affairs representatives, is investigating how to further mutually beneficial collaborations with the Bellairs Research Institute and other Caribbean institutions engaged in research and learning. The group is focused on topics such as Barbadian-Canadian relations, Caribbean studies, slavery studies, post-imperial studies, sustainability studies, and the blue economy, which is the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs.Razak also explained the hierarchy of knowledge within the medical field. He suggested that by engaging to a greater degree in co-creative research practices – research that involves the people it seeks to serve – the knowledge generated will be of greater benefit to society. He cited the example of research on hypertension in Black and South Asian populations where the prevalence of the disease is high. When researching the disease, he advised, scientists must consult and co-create the research questions with patients from the impacted communities. As an example, he cited the development of pulse oximeters, which were tested on light-skinned individuals in the 1980s, and as a result, are less effective when used for dark-skinned individuals.Decolonization is not a metaphorJamilah Dei-Sharpe, whose research is focused on Black masculinities in Canada, expanded the discussion of research conducted on human participants, specifically racialized people. “Decolonizing research is a commitment to acknowledging and replacing approaches that have carried the same dehumanizing and exploitative practices established in the 15th and 19th centuries during the Euro-colonial regime,” she said. “To make sure that decolonization is not a metaphor, I believe that this research must also strive for material change.”Dei-Sharpe explained that material change could include sharing and retrieving Indigenous knowledges, while also replacing systems that impede Indigenous sovereignty, Black freedom, and Asian and gender-diverse rights. She called attention to the western scientific method, which since the 17th century has set the standard for who and what is studied in research institutions— a method that has positioned Europeans and white people as authorities. She presented the idea that research, defined by Dei-Sharpe as “the practice of watching, categorizing and conducting interventions on the other,” has underpinned colonial practices by justifying domination of racialized people.  She emphasized that by excluding racialized people from the design and execution of research these attitudes persist.Dei-Sharp pointed to her doctoral research as an example of decolonizing the classroom. She and her research team have created pedagogical packages based on interviews with grassroots organizers who are dedicated to combating systemic racism in the context of COVID-19. These packages included critical questions and assignments. “In this form, we were telling the educators and the students that there are ways to take oral history and lived experiences and bring it into your lives and your work,” she said. “Cite it, bring it into your syllabus— it’s all about the methodology that you use.”Celebrating Black excellence in researchGivens, who joined McGill in June 2021, stated that her goal is to change the discipline of political science. She called for more diverse faculty hiring, and for research institutions to value the research these faculty members conduct. She reflected on the trajectory of her career as an academic and the barriers she faced in conducting research. “When I started out as a researcher in the 1990s, the study of race was seen as marginal,” she said. “In trying to study issues of race in Europe, I could not even use the term race – despite the history, it was considered problematic.” She added, “this is why I wrote my book The Roots of Racism to show how historically the racialization of peoples is entwined in that transatlantic perspective.”The Roots of Racism: The Politics of White Supremacy in the US and Europe, published in 2022, focuses in part on trailblazing Black researchers, such as Nobel Laureate Ralph Bunche, a pioneer in decolonizing research and a civil rights leader, and Merze Tate, the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in government and international relations from Harvard University and who later joined the Department of History at Howard University as one of only two female faculty members. Givens also celebrated W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.Givens lamented that in her study of immigration policy, she was often told by colleagues that there was no connection between colonialism and immigration, a perspective she categorized as “so not true – the only way you can understand why certain people go to other countries is because of colonial relationships.”The student perspectiveAlso participating in the discussion were Asia Blackman, masters student in epidemiology and the first recipient of the inaugural Charles R. Drew Fellowship, and Khaelan King, a McGill undergraduate student.As a political science major, King reflected that, “colonization plays a huge role in the way that academia at McGill is generally perceived.” She added that, “through my time as a student I have hardly had any classes that don’t emphasize colonialism. I think that in order to actively educate our student body from a global perspective, our research methods and the selection of professors has to be more inclusive.” She pointed to the fact that at McGill some professors actively make their syllabi more inclusive, an example she hopes is followed by more faculty members.Blackman echoed this point, arguing that university courses must grapple with white supremacy’s roots in health research, the practice of global health, as well as its impact on population health. She added, “I think it is important to acknowledge that decolonization is a multi-step process that employs undoing the dominant structure and it can’t be accomplished in just a few small steps.” In agreement, Givens voiced a key takeaway from the panel discussion: “If we can’t name it, then we can’t address it.”A recording of the panel discussion will be available shortly.","Thu, 02/24/2022 - 13:56"
Stroke: Not on women’s radars,"Would you be surprised to learn that stroke kills twice as many women as breast cancer each year? Despite this fact, stroke generally ranks lower on the list of Canadian women’s health concerns – if it makes the list at all.While women may know that they are more at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or migraine than men, they may not realize that this is also the case for other serious neurological conditions such as stroke. And the lack of information can mean women don’t recognize a serious health event when it happens.Connecting heart and stroke healthThe Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada estimates that stroke affects 1 in 5 Canadian women. And despite tremendous advances in treatment in the last decade, stroke remains an urgent life-threatening event, which can be complicated by pre-existing conditions.“Over the age of 60, women are overrepresented in stroke because they are more likely to suffer from atrial fibrillation, which is a cardiac arrhythmia that is an important risk factor,” explains Dr. Catherine Legault, a stroke neurologist at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital). “Their strokes are often more severe than those of men, and their complications are greater.”Patients with a history of atrial fibrillation regularly take anticoagulant medication to lessen the risk of a clot-provoked stroke. However, if they are also predisposed to have a hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the brain), this anti-clotting medication may contribute to increase the risk of bleeding.The Clinical Research Unit at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) is taking part in a clinical trial (ENRICH-AF) for individuals who have suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and who have a history of atrial fibrillation. The trial is studying whether being given an anticoagulant to lessen the risk of a clot-provoked stroke outweighs the low risk of re-bleeding.“This study should clarify for us which is the better decision to make in this potentially more at-risk population,” explains Dr. Aimen Moussaddy, a neurologist who specializes in vascular neurology at The Neuro and the principal investigator for the ENRICH trial at the CRU.Hormones and strokeWomen also need to be aware that there are other unique risk factors for them in relation to stroke; some of these occur around hormonal changes such as the peripartum and postpartum period, as well as after menopause. Other factors such as depression, anxiety and high psychological stress are also associated with an increased risk of stroke, more so in women than in men.“Women are also less likely to recognize their stroke symptoms and less likely to present to the hospital,” says Dr. Legault.  Stroke symptoms are easy to remember: facial weakness or facial asymmetry; weakness or change in sensation in an arm or leg on one side; difficulty speaking or understanding language; visual changes or dizziness.That said, women may also experience “non-traditional” symptoms such as sudden severe headache, fainting, weakness, shortness of breath, confusion and nausea. The Heart and Stroke Foundation estimates that two thirds of research is carried out on men, and therefore women’s symptoms may be less studied and less frequently mentioned.If there is one message Dr. Legault wants to send women, it’s this: “Listen to your body; if you feel the symptoms of a stroke, don’t try sleep it off. Call 911 and come to the ER as soon as possible.” The speed of intervention following a stroke can mean the difference between walking away unscathed or having serious complications.*****Les AVC : pas dans la mire des femmes Alors que les femmes sont surreprésentées dans de nombreux troubles neurologiques majeurs, la plupart ne savent pas qu’elles sont à risqueSeriez-vous surprise d’apprendre que chaque année les accidents vasculaires cérébraux (AVC) tuent deux fois plus de femmes que le cancer du sein? Pourtant, en général, les AVC se classent au bas sur la liste des problèmes de santé des femmes canadiennes – s’ils réussissent même à s’y classer.Bien que beaucoup de femmes savent qu’elles sont plus à risque de développer la maladie d’Alzheimer ou la migraine que les hommes, elles ne réalisent peut-être pas que c’est également le cas pour d’autres troubles neurologiques tels les AVC. Et ce manque d’informations peut faire en sorte que les femmes ne reconnaissent pas un problème de santé grave lorsqu’il se produit.Relier la santé du cœur et du cerveauLa Fondation Cœur + AVC estime que l’AVC touche une Canadienne sur cinq. Malgré d’énormes progrès en matière de traitement, un accident vasculaire cérébral reste une urgence vitale qui peut être compliqué par des conditions préexistantes.« Chez les personnes de plus de 60 ans, les femmes sont surreprésentées dans les cas d’AVC parce qu’elles sont plus susceptibles de souffrir de fibrillation auriculaire, une arythmie cardiaque qui est un facteur de risque important », explique la Dre Catherine Legault, neurologue spécialisée en AVC au Neuro (Institut-Hôpital Neurologique de Montréal) qui siège sur un comité national sur la santé des femmes. “Les AVC chez les femmes sont souvent plus sévères que ceux des hommes et leurs déficits sont plus marqués.”Les patients ayant des antécédents de fibrillation auriculaire peuvent prendre un anticoagulant pour réduire le risque d’AVC provoqué par un caillot. Cependant, s’ils sont également prédisposés à avoir un accident vasculaire cérébral hémorragique (saignement dans le cerveau), ce médicament anticoagulant peut contribuer à augmenter le risque de saignement.L’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro (Institut-Hôpital neurologique de Montréal) participe à un essai clinique (ENRICH-AF) auprès de personnes ayant subi un AVC hémorragique et ayant des antécédents de fibrillation auriculaire. L’essai étudiera si l’administration d’un anticoagulant pour réduire le risque d’accident vasculaire cérébral provoqué par un caillot l’emporte sur le faible risque de récidive hémorragique.« Cette étude devrait nous éclairer sur la meilleure décision à prendre dans cette population potentiellement plus à risque », explique le Dr Aimen Moussaddy, neurologue spécialisé en neurologie vasculaire au Neuro et chercheur principal de l’essai ENRICH au CRU.Les hormones et les AVCIl existe des facteurs de risque uniques chez les femmes, par exemple les moments de grands changements hormonaux comme la période péri-partum et post-partum, ainsi qu’après la ménopause. D’autres facteurs tels que la dépression, l’anxiété et un stress psychologique élevé sont également associés à un risque accru d’AVC, plus souvent chez les femmes que chez les hommes.« Les femmes ont également moins tendance à reconnaitre leurs symptômes d’AVC ou à se présenter à l’hôpital avec ces symptômes », explique la Dre Legault. Les symptômes d’AVC sont faciles à retenir : faiblesse faciale ou asymétrie faciale ; faiblesse ou changement de sensation dans un membre ou d’un côté ; difficulté à parler ou à comprendre le langage ; changements visuels ou étourdissements. Les femmes peuvent également éprouver des symptômes « non traditionnels » tels que des évanouissements, une faiblesse, un essoufflement, de la confusion et des nausées.S’il y a un message que la Dre Legault veut faire passer aux femmes, c’est ceci : « Écoutez votre corps; si vous ressentez les symptômes d’un AVC, n’attendez pas que ça passe. Appelez le 911 et venez aux urgences dès que possible. » La rapidité d’intervention à la suite d’un AVC peut faire la différence entre s’en sortir indemne ou avoir de graves complications.Pour en savoir plus sur les essais sur les AVC à l’URC, visitez cru.mcgill.ca/fr/avc","Thu, 02/24/2022 - 10:17"
McGill shows interest in sustainability on campus and beyond: 2021 Sustainability Survey,"Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important to the McGill community, with more respondents saying they believe that is important that the University has a strong commitment to sustainability and that they believe that McGill values sustainability, when compared to previous yearsMost McGill community members hope to become involved in sustainability on campus, results from the 2021 Sustainability Survey show.More than 3,000 McGillians responded to the Survey, administered by the Office of Sustainability in late 2021, providing a pulse check on the community’s perception of sustainability, on campus and beyond. Variations of the Sustainability Survey have been circulated annually since 2019 to gauge community interest in and awareness of ongoing sustainability initiatives.“Understanding our community’s perception of sustainability is integral to our work as we shape the future of sustainability at McGill,” says Executive Director of Sustainability Francois Miller. “I extend my deepest thanks to all those who took the time to share their thoughts.”The 2021 Survey saw a jump in overall interest in sustainability on campus, with 92 per cent of respondents saying they believe that it is important that the University has a strong commitment to sustainability. Even further, 74 per cent of McGillians believe that their actions have an impact on the University’s sustainability performance.Similarly, the McGill community expressed a desire to be involved. Nearly a quarter of staff said they have already been involved in a sustainability project or initiative, and over two-thirds of students and more than half of staff and faculty said they would like to attend a sustainability-oriented event, workshop, or training.Keeping the conversation goingLike in past years, waste reduction proved to be top of mind for the McGill community, with many expressing their desire for more resources to support sustainable waste habits.Since the circulation of the 2021 survey, compost collection has begun in nine academic buildings on the downtown campus, with expansion to an additional 18 buildings planned for early 2022. The new infrastructure is set to collect at least an additional 100 tonnes of organic waste per year and will be complemented by a new waste education program, in development by the Office of Sustainability.Survey respondents equally expressed an appetite for hearing more about the University’s own sustainability commitments, with a desire to remain involved in and updated on the implementation process.The 2020-2021 Climate & Sustainability Annual Report, released in October 2021, highlights sustainable progress made across the eight categories of the Climate & Sustainability Strategy and McGill’s Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF). A detailed progress report focused on the Climate & Sustainability Strategy will be published in 2023, reflecting on the first two years of its implementation.To learn more about the University’s sustainability initiatives and how to get involved, visit mcgill.ca/sustainability and sign up for the Office of Sustainability’s monthly newsletter.McGill community members said they are most aware of sustainability initiatives and events with strong in-person aspects, with Indigenous Awareness Week and the McGill Farmers’ Market landing at the top of the list.","Thu, 02/24/2022 - 09:12"
$3.1 M for eight McGill research projects,"McGill researchers (top, r to l): Hsiu-Chin Lin, Danilo Bzdok, Guojun Chen, and Jesse Shapiro. (Bottom l to r): Mehran Dastmalchi, Jessica Gillung, Boris Vaisband and Djordje Romanic In Quebec, over 6,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed and approximately 1,350 women die from the disease each year. Today, a research project led by Assistant Professor Guojun Chen (Department of Biomedical Engineering) received $429,816 through the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) John R. Evans Leaders Fund (JELF) and the Government of Quebec to develop more effective treatments for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Among all types of breast cancer, TNBC is more aggressive, and the prognoses are poor due to the lack of effective clinical treatment options.Parliamentary Secretary Andy Fillmore made the announcement in Ottawa of CFI JELF funding valued at more than $30 million for 136 research infrastructure projects at 31 universities across Canada. Eight McGill research projects are beneficiaries for a total investment of $1,572 397. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education or the Ministry of Health and Social Services of the Government of Quebec makes matching investments in each of the McGill-led projects. Thanks to these matching funds, the total investment in research infrastructure at McGill will top $3.1 million.“Investments in research infrastructure are investments in McGill’s research excellence,” said Martha Crago, Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation. “The funding announced today by the Governments of Canada and Quebec supports a diverse set of research programs that will reap benefits for Canada’s healthcare systems and the environment, and push the envelope in AI, genomics, and super-computing.”The grants provided to institutions through the John. R. Evans Leaders Fund enable the retention and recruitment of leading researchers and support their innovative work by providing critical research infrastructure. With the funding invested today, Chen’s Biomaterials and Device Engineering Laboratory will invest in essential equipment for plasma generation, chemical synthesis, cell cultures, and protein and nucleic acid analysis.  “With this investment, McGill University will, for the first time, leverage the synergy between cold atmospheric plasma therapy and cancer immunotherapy for TNBC treatment,” said Chen. “The infrastructure will enable researchers to combine biomaterials engineering, medical device engineering and immunoengineering technologies to pursue innovative and translational research for breast cancer treatment.”For Assistant Professor Djordje Romanic of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, the funds will support the purchasing of a remote sensing instrument on McGill’s downtown campus to conduct research on the urban boundary-layer (UBL), which is the lowest part of the atmosphere. More research is needed on the complex dynamics and thermodynamic interactions between the UBL and the microclimate created by cities. The new instrument, called Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging Wind Profiler), will record wind and turbulence at different elevations above downtown Montreal. Lidar will give Romanic’s research team important information about UBL wind profile, UBL evolution, pollutant dispersion, urban thunderstorm winds, wind engineering, urban wind energy, and will inform research on improved sustainability and resilience measures for Canadian cities in adapting to climate change.Assistant Professor (Natural Resource Sciences) and Director of the Lyman Entomological Museum Jessica Gillung is the recipient of a CFI JELF grant to better understand the evolutionary ecology and drivers of diversification of parasitoid insects. A parasitoid insect develops in or on the body of a single host individual, eventually killing that host. There are an estimated 200,000 known species of parasitoid insects, and they comprise about a fifth of the total insect diversity. To explore their diversity and evolution, Gillung’s research program will analyze parasitoidy through museomics –  the genomic study of organisms that are found in museum collections – and high-throughput sequencing. The funds will be directed to purchasing essential equipment and systems for the study, such as a DNA acquisition module. “I hope that the results of this research program will inform scientists and the public on the ecological and economic importance to of the ecosystem services delivered by these organisms,” said Gillung.List of CFI JELF projects funded in this round: Project title: Big Biomedical Data and Machine Learning to Understand the Human Association CortexProject Leader: Danilo Bzdok, Department of Biomedical EngineeringCFI JELF Funds: $100,154Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $100,154Total Project budget: $200,308Project title: Biomaterials and Device Engineering LaboratoryProject leader: Guojun Chen, Department of Biomedical EngineeringCFI JELF funds: $214 908Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $214,908Total Project budget: $429,816Project title: Exploring Chemical Diversity in Legume Species and Building Biofoundries for High-value MetabolitesProject leader: Mehran Dasmaltchi, Department of Plant ScienceCFI JELF funding: $380,170Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $380,170Total Project budget: $760,340Project title: Lyman Laboratory of Insect Diversity and PhylogenomicsProject leader: Jessica Gillung, Department of Natural Resource SciencesCFI JELF funds: $309,495Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $309,495Total Project budget: $618,990Project title: Adaptive and Stable Control of Legged Robotics in Complex EnvironmentsProject Leader: Hsiu-Chin Lin, jointly appointed between the School of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical and Computer EngineeringCFI JELF Funds: $150,000Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $150,000Total Project budget: $300,000Project title: Urban Boundary-layer Processes and their Links to Sustainability and ResilienceProject leader: Djordje Romanic, Department Atmospheric and Oceanic SciencesCFI JELF funds: $97,200Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $97,200Total Project budget: $194,400Project title: The Laboratory for Microbial Evolutionary GenomicsProject lead: Jesse Shapiro, Department of Microbiology and ImmunologyCFI JELF funds: $205,170Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $205,170Total Project budget: $410,340Project title: Heterogeneous Integration LabProject leader: Boris Vaisband, Department of Electrical & Computer EngineeringCFI JELF funding: $115,300Matching funds from Government of Quebec: $115,300Total Project budget: $230,600Read the original press release.","Tue, 02/22/2022 - 13:41"
Face masks impair nonverbal communication between individuals,"Since the onset of the worldwide pandemic, face masks have been widely adopted to control the spread of COVID-19. While masks are critical for mitigating disease contagion, they hide parts of our faces which are used for nonverbal communication to express our emotions and intentions.In a recent study, a team of researchers from the Laboratory for Attention and Social Cognition at McGill University compared how over 120 individuals recognize emotions: happy, sad, fearful, angry, disgusted, surprised, and neutral facial expressions in masked and unmasked faces. Not surprisingly, they found that face masks reduced the ability to recognize facial expressions for all emotions. Thus, obscuring face parts alters human social communication.We sat down with the Department of Psychology’s Jelena Ristic, Professor in Psychology and William Dawson Scholar, and Sarah McCrackin, Postdoctoral Fellow, to discus the findings of the study.What question(s) did you set out to answer?Humans have evolved to communicate via the silent language of faces. As a result, we are able to read a number of simple (e.g., eye gaze) and complex (e.g., intentions) social messages from faces alone. One of the most important cues we receive from faces is facial expression, which signals the individual’s emotional state.With the sudden and widespread adoption of face masks in 2020 to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, we set out to investigate how covering the lower part of the face with a mask impacted our ability to recognize basic emotions from facial expressions. We also wanted to assess if this behaviour varied with individual participants’ personality traits and their level of social ability.What did you find?Our data showed that recognition of all facial expressions was affected when faces were masked, reducing overall recognition accuracy by about 24 per cent. However, this reduction varied with emotion; identification of disgust (46 per cent accuracy reduction) and anger (30 per cent) were impacted the most by masks. Sadness (23 per cent) and neutral expressions (23 per cent) were impacted an intermediate amount. Fear (10 per cent), surprise (15 per cent), and happiness (15 per cent) were impacted the least.The magnitude of the impact of masks on emotion recognition demonstrates that visual information from lower face is important for reading emotions from facial expressions. For example, because recognition of disgust and anger were most impacted by obscuring the lower face, we concluded that these two expressions most strongly utilize social cues from this facial area.Correlation analyses indicated that the effects were generally stable across individuals, with little variation with individual traits. People who ranked higher in terms of trait agreeableness, which includes attributes like altruism and prosocial behaviour, had slightly better emotion recognition when faces wore masks compared to people lower in trait agreeableness. In contrast, those higher in extroversion, characterized by a tendency to seek out social contact, had slightly worse emotion recognition when faces wore masks than those lower in extroversion. Finally, those who showed higher levels of social competence were better able to recognize emotional expression from unmasked faces than those with lower social competence.Why are the results important?The human social landscape underwent rapid change with the worldwide onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. One of the biggest changes was an unprecedented and widespread adoption of face masks. While we want to emphasize that wearing a mask is critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19, it is also important that we understand the impact that face masks may have on human social interactions. This is especially true in a time where many are feeling socially isolated, given that the ability to recognize facial expressions is a fundamental part of social interactions and is linked to overall social and cognitive functioning.Beyond the pandemic, these results have importance for health and educational settings in which masks have been or have become commonplace. For example, doctor-patient relations require easy interpretation of emotional states for better patient outcomes. Anger and sadness are two emotions that commonly come up when dealing with difficult medical problems, and our data suggest these emotions are two of the most impacted by masks. Further, as human psychosocial development depends on accurate interpretation of social cues from faces, mask wearing in educational settings may exert long lasting consequences for social development in children. While the need to wear masks in the pandemic is unquestionable, one recommendation that follows from our preliminary data from the ongoing studies on this topic is that wearing FDA approved transparent face masks may help to alleviate some (but not all) of the social difficulties resulting from facial occlusion by masks.In summary, our study shows that human social functioning has been heavily impacted by the pandemic in more ways than perhaps we considered.Read the study online.","Tue, 02/22/2022 - 10:48"
Return to full in-person activities in Fall 2022 / Reprise de toutes les activités en personne à l’automne 2022,"Staff | 22 Feb 2022            Campus updates Add to calendarFacebookLinkedInTweet Widget This message is sent on behalf of Christopher Manfredi, Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic), and Yves Beauchamp, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance).Le présent message est envoyé au nom de Christopher Manfredi, vice-principal exécutif et vice-principal aux études, et de Yves Beauchamp, vice-principal (Administration et finances). La version française suit Dear members of the McGill community,Over the past few weeks, most learning activities for the Winter semester have returned to in-person delivery. Staff members who have been working remotely will begin a gradual return starting February 28. COVID-related measures are slowly being lifted across the province and country, and governments and public health officials are emphasizing that we are moving into a new phase of dealing with COVID-19. In this context, questions have naturally been raised about the Fall 2022 semester. McGill plans to return to full in-person activities for the Fall 2022 semester. That is, all the activities that were in-person prior to the pandemic will return to in-person, including large lectures. We expect that all staff will be back on campus, with the Interim Flexible Work Arrangement in place for eligible employees. The world has changed, of course, and this will not be a complete “return to normal.” Appropriate measures will still be in place to ensure that our campuses continue to be safe and we will remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to evolve. The lessons we have learned from having to adapt quickly and often during a global pandemic, whether in teaching, research, operations or other activities, will continue to inform our practices. The past two years have been difficult for many of us. So many people have pulled together to keep McGill strong throughout this time, often while dealing with schooling children at home and health related concerns. A big thank-you to everyone who has brought us this far along the road. We will continue to keep our community informed about the Fall semester. As usual, we will provide regular updates as we continue to return to more in-person activities over the coming months. With best wishes,Christopher Manfredi, Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic)Yves Beauchamp, Vice-Principal (Administration and Finance)  Chers membres de la communauté mcgilloise,Au cours des dernières semaines, la majorité des activités d’apprentissage de la session d’hiver sont revenues à un mode de prestation en personne. Les membres du personnel qui travaillent à distance à l’heure actuelle amorceront un retour graduel au travail en personne à compter du 28 février. Nous commençons à voir la levée de certaines mesures de protection contre la COVID‑19 dans la province ainsi qu’ailleurs au pays, et les représentants du gouvernement et de la santé publique affirment que nous entrons dans une nouvelle phase de gestion de la pandémie. Naturellement, ce contexte donne lieu à des questions concernant la session d’automne 2022.L’Université McGill prévoit un retour aux activités en personne à la session d’automne 2022. Cela signifie que toutes les activités qui se donnaient en personne avant le début de la pandémie reviendront à un mode de prestation en présentiel, y compris les cours magistraux donnés devant un vaste auditoire. Nous nous attendons à ce que tout le personnel reprenne son travail sur le campus, à l’exception des employés admissibles qui souhaitent se prévaloir des modalités de travail flexible intérimaire.Évidemment, les choses ont changé et la situation ne reviendra pas à la normale de sitôt. Nous continuerons d’appliquer toutes les mesures nécessaires pour assurer la sécurité de nos campus et nous surveillerons de près l’évolution de la pandémie. Nous avons appris à nous adapter rapidement et fréquemment en temps de pandémie et nous continuerons de faire bon usage de cette faculté d’adaptation — en enseignement, en recherche, en gestion des opérations et pour toute autre activité — selon les besoins.Les deux dernières années ont été difficiles pour plusieurs d’entre nous.

Do emotions impact decisions on punishment in the context of crime?,"Anger is a key emotion in understanding public opinion towards crime and punishment: it is frequently mobilized in public discourse and is elicited by specific incidents. But what role do emotions play in questions of punishment for crime? In a new article published in Psychology, Crime & Law, a research team from McGill University, Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) and the University of Ottawa, were able to quantify for the first time that individuals deciding whether a criminalized person should be incarcerated, experienced an almost instantaneous emotional reaction.“We are very excited about these findings because it allows us to show when and how emotion emerges when making decisions regarding punishment for crime,” says lead researcher, Carolyn Côté-Lussier, a Professor of Urban Studies at INRS and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminology at the University of Ottawa. This research was conducted at the INSPIRE Laboratory.An innovative approach in criminologyThe researchers used a technology called facial electromyography (fEMG) to measure, in microvolts, the activation of muscles that are responsible for frowning. Participants (87 students) were asked to decide, whether or not, a pictured individual should be given a prison or non-prison sentence. They were asked to make this decision as quickly as possible based on their gut reaction to nearly 50 pictures of criminalized men.Although it took an average of 1.3 seconds to make a punitive decision, anger was apparent within less than a second (0.5 seconds). The speed of this angry emotional response suggests it is automatic and effortless. “The research shows that the experience of anger is apparent before an individual can formulate an opinion about a specific crime or about the current crime rate, or even the purpose of sending someone to prison,” explains co-author on the project, Jean-Denis David, who is a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at McGill.Moreover, this angry emotional reaction was stronger when responding to a pictured individual that resembled a “stereotypical criminal”. These criminalized individuals tend to be seen as being less warm, more callous, and also as having a low social status, for instance having low educational attainment or a low paying job.Emotions over factsPrevious research led by Prof. Côté-Lussier in 2013 has shown that criminalized individuals with angry facial expressions were more likely to be punished harshly. However, it lacked the capacity to show that intuitive angry reactions led to such decisions.“Part of what this research does is to remind us that we can’t get rid of emotion. It’s omnipresent,” adds Prof. Côté-Lussier. “I want policy makers to keep that in mind, especially when analyzing opinion polls. If we can become aware of our biases, our emotions, it could help us have a more critical eye.”The researchers are working on additional analyses linking these reactions to broader attitudes toward criminal justice policy. “We want to demonstrate that when people say we should punish crime more harshly, they are relying on intuitive emotional reactions and not on cold hard facts about crime” says Prof. Côté-Lussier.The researchers say future studies could help confirm and expand on these findings, by improving the confidentiality of surveys and collecting more data on the use of HIV treatment.Read the study.","Thu, 02/17/2022 - 14:49"
Prioritizing supports to specific neighbourhoods is key to curbing COVID-19 transmission,"The COVID-19 pandemic has uneven impacts across cities and provinces, with some regions struggling more than others. A new study shows hotspots of COVID-19 infections across Canadian cities are linked to occupation, income, housing, and markers for structural racism.To better understand the factors contributing to the concentration of infections in specific regions, a team of researchers across Canada, including Yiqing Xia, David Buckeridge, and Mathieu Maheu-Giroux of McGill University, analyzed provincial surveillance data from January 2020 to February 2021. The study, which looked at infections in 16 urban centres in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, and Manitoba, is published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.Patterns of COVID-19 transmission within cities“In each of the cities we examined, 50 per cent of cases were concentrated in areas that accounted for less than 21 per cent to 35 per cent of the population. In these regions the factors associated with case concentration varied slightly depending on local contexts,” says Maheu-Giroux, a Canada Research Chair in Population Health Modeling.“Across all provinces, cases were geographically concentrated along social determinants of health. These include neighbourhoods with high-density housing, more essential workers, residents with lower income or educational attainment, and a higher proportion of visible minorities or recent immigrants,” says lead author Yiqing Xia, a McGill PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health.The researchers found that the most common social determinant of health across all cities was visible minority status. These findings are consistent with other studies from Canada as well as Sweden, the United States, and other countries showing higher rates of COVID-19 in vulnerable communities or diverse neighbourhoods.During the study period, there were 63,266 COVID-19 cases in British Columbia, 15,089 in Manitoba, 239,160 in Ontario and 224,377 in Quebec recorded in the 16 metropolitan areas. They accounted for 81 per cent, 57 per cent, 83 per cent and 80 per cent of all confirmed cases in each province respectively.COVID-19 hotspots in Quebec“What is striking in our analyses, is that we observe similar patterns in all the Quebec cities examined: cases are concentrated along social determinants of health in Gatineau, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, and Trois-Rivières,” says Mathieu Maheu-Giroux.“In Montreal, the local Direction régionale de santé publique has at times prioritized some interventions like testing and vaccines to specific areas of the city that experienced high COVID-19 transmission. There is a need to scale-up these initiatives to make our pandemic response more efficient,” he adds.Focusing on populations at greater risk of infection“Understanding the factors associated with geographic patterns of transmission within cities can help identify the populations and, specifically, the contexts with the greatest risks,” says Dr. Sharmistha Mishra of St. Michael’s Hospital and Unity Health Toronto. “Geographic analyses can enable better allocation of resources, tailoring of policies and implementation of context-specific strategies to more effectively and efficiently curb local transmission,” she says.To effectively reach and meet the prevention and care needs of communities at disproportionate risk of COVID, the authors call for geographically prioritized public health supports for hotspots across the country, like vaccination rollouts and testing in specific areas. “Prioritizing specific neighbourhoods that are most at risk of transmission offers a clear path forward in the public health response to COVID-19’s resurgence,” they conclude.Read the study.","Thu, 02/17/2022 - 14:43"
Historic bonds behind renewed agreement with University of Glasgow,"This past week, no doubt there were thousands – if not millions – of Zoom calls taking place around the world. But one international call in particular took on historic dimensions. At an online ceremony on Tuesday, February 8, McGill University and the University of Glasgow renewed their ties through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).This event marked the second time such an agreement has been reached between the two institutions, who signed a similar document in 2015. However, the echoes of history travel much further back than a mere few years ago. Indeed, the entire existence of McGill as an institution owes a tremendous debt to its counterpart school as James McGill himself was an alumnus of Glasgow, where he graduated with a degree in arts in 1756.‘Unifying desire to change the world for the better’With this education in the background, it is no surprise that McGill’s eponymous university and his alma mater should today find themselves very much on the same page. Rachel Sandison, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, External Engagement and Vice-Principal, External Relations for University of Glasgow and one of the MOU’s signatories, expressed this mostly clearly in her introductory remarks: “As institutions, our goals, ambitions and civic responsibilities are closely aligned,” she said. “We have the unifying desire to change the world for the better.”It was a sentiment echoed by counter signer Christopher Manfredi, Provost and Academic Vice-Principal for McGill University. “The ties between our schools have strengthened over the years,” he explained, adding that “this has helped establish new avenues of collaboration, and stronger ties with the rest of the United Kingdom.”In support of this point, Provost Manfredi noted that 2,000 McGill alumni currently live in the UK, McGill has eight research and cooperation agreements with institutions there, and that over 400 sponsored research projects have been undertaken in the past five years between McGill and UK-based researchers.Provost Manfredi also used his speech to remind participants that Principal Suzanne Fortier was bestowed with an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Glasgow in 2015, providing further evidence of the deep bonds of academic friendship between the two organizations.Opportunities to collaborateThe Zoom call was followed by a symposium to discuss the numerous areas on which the institutions could collaborate. Subjects covered included English literature, Political Science, Nutrition, Neuroimaging, Animal and Veterinary Science, the Caribbean, Early Career Researcher + Joint PhDs, and Slavery Studies.Rachel Sandison, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, External Engagement and Vice-Principal, External Relations for University of Glasgow and Christopher Manfredi, Provost and Academic Vice-Principal for McGill, celebrate the signing of the MOU between the universitiesIn the Caribbean session, participants included the Bellairs Research Institute (a McGill field station located in the Barbados) and the University of West Indies (UWI). The UWI in 2019, together with the University of Glasgow, launched the Glasgow-Caribbean Centre for Development Research to examine issues of health, development, and the cultural gap between the Caribbean and Africa. The session touched on numerous topics including sustainability, diaspora literature, and black identity.Clearly, any discussion of McGill and Glasgow – whether as individuals or localities – must include reference to the slave trade in which both institutions were involved. In this light, the Slavery Studies session was a notable topic. The role of slavery as a vector for viral transmission was one discussion thread that emerged in this group.The English literature forum explored ideas around the possible development of a joint master’s program (to be determined), before focusing on a joint online seminar series as a concrete activity that could be launched in the short term. Meanwhile, in the Animal/Veterinary Science group, there was much discussion about opening a pathway for McGill students who are interested in veterinary studies to begin their degree at McGill and transfer to Glasgow’s School of Veterinary Medicine, along the lines of an existing McGill program. Doubtless, the other breakout rooms saw as much enthusiasm and energy in their interactions.The terms of the MOU are not restricted to any particular field of study and aim to facilitate exchange for students and researchers alike. The agreement simply seeks to formalize what was manifestly clear from the numerous conversations: that there is much to be exchanged and shared between these two universities, and that this mutually beneficial interaction is likely to continue for many years to come.","Wed, 02/16/2022 - 14:40"
Meet Dayna Danger: McGill’s Mellon Indigenous Artist in Residence,"Dayna Danger Talking with Dayna Danger, McGill’s Mellon Indigenous Artist in Residence for 2022, is nothing if not a rollicking, fascinating adventure. Veering this way and that, a scheduled 20-minute Zoom interview turns into an hour-long discussion of history, philosophy, laughter and thought-provoking ideas. “Hey, this is also how I know I’m Indigenous, because I can’t tell a straight story ever,” Danger said with a chuckle. “It’s always in a circle.”Founded in 2019, the Mellon Indigenous Artist in Residence program is one of the initiatives funded by the five-year US$1.25-million grant by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in to support McGill’s Indigenous Studies and Community Engagement Initiative (ISCEI). The program brings practicing artists to campus to continue their work, share their expertise, interact with students and faculty members, and enhance knowledge of and exposure to Indigenous art among the campus community and the public at large. Danger is a visual artist. Through utilizing the processes of photography, sculpture, performance and video, Danger creates works and environments that question the line between empowerment and objectification by claiming the space.“Dayna Danger’s work challenges long-held stereotypes of Indigenous art. Through mediums like photography, performance, and beadwork their art practice creates space for community, conversation, and representation,” said Gwendolyn Owens, Director, Visual Arts Collection at McGill. “The Indigenous Artist in Residence program is a terrific opportunity for students to interact with artists like Dayna Danger who are important, not just because of their identity, but also because they are original and creative thinkers.”Dayna Danger will deliver their first Artist’s Talk as Mellon Artist in Residence on February 21, at 2 p.m. The presentation will take place on Zoom. Registration is required.The Reporter spoke with Danger recently at the very start of their residency.You are the second ISCEI Artist in Residence. How important is it for McGill – and other institutions like McGill – to have initiatives like this?It’s a great initiative. I’ve been in think tanks on different Indigenous committees that have been pushing for something like this for a long time.When you enter into new spaces, if there haven’t been [Indigenous] people there before us, it’s a huge learning curve, both for us interacting with the institution and for the institution interacting with us.Our wants and needs are not always the same as what you would find in standard western institutions.In what ways?I don’t want to pan-Indigenize, but there are a lot of differences in the way we like to work and the way we like to communicate. We know what is most effective for us and our communities, how we want to put our art out there, and what relationship-building looks like.Sometimes Indigenous artists can be skeptical about who they work with because if we don’t know you, we don’t know what that relationship – what that reciprocity – will look like, and what people’s expectations are for us.The fact that McGill has so many Indigenous staff on board who are leading this is great.Tell us about your family.My father is Polish and Roman Catholic and my mom is Métis-Saulteaux. There’s also some Scottish and French there.My great grandmother, whose about to turn 100, speaks three different languages.She’s was born on the land, not in a hospital, born by Métis midwives in Camperville. She was telling me the story about how much she hates stoves. When she first moved to the city, she just wanted a fire to make tea, and she couldn’t figure out the damn electric stove. She just didn’t like it and found it so cumbersome. It was so much easier to make a fire at the fish camp or wherever she was working. I think about that a lot.I saw a video in which you describe yourself as ‘a Métis-Saulteaux-Polish, queer, Two Spirit, hard fem, visual artist.’ It immediately brought to mind Walt Whitman’s famous ‘Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; (I am large. I contain multitudes).’ How do the multitudes contained within you inform your art? Are there contradictions and conflicts that manifest themselves in your work?I live for the contradiction. It’s the questioning. In my work, I’m always asking questions. I don’t claim to know the answers and I don’t know if other people know the answers. But, because of my upbringing, I’m open to every perspective and answer.Do I contradict myself? I feel like that’s a really huge part of the Métis identity.These are questions I get asked a lot – What does it mean to be a Métis artist, what does it mean to be a queer artist? It’s important to talk about different world views, about resistance, about pushback.Even in my body I have many different world views which are at odds with each other. There’s a whole history of the Métis along with our Indigenous ancestors. It’s a coming together of different world views and wanting to hold on to that spiritualism and culture.And for me, I used to [call myself] hard fem, but that’s changed because everything is so fluid. What do you do when you, as a person, feel very fluid in your presentation? What I look like now versus what I looked like then? It’s very different. How does that change and shift my perception?You use a lot of different media. Do you choose the medium depending upon the question you are asking or the contradiction you are exploring?The Outlander, Bad Girls, 2013, 44 x 66 inches, digital photograph I have a set of tools and in my wheelhouse, there is photography, there is sculpture, there is performance, there is video. I am getting more into illustration now because of the beadwork I’m doing.Maybe I’m drawn toward those contradictions because I’m living in a world that doesn’t quite feel made for me.This could be the little crux on my back from being a recovering Catholic [Laughing]. I do not fit into this world whatsoever. But I respect that that’s the faith my family has chosen. But what does that mean for me, knowing that I probably will never be accepted in the church or as part of that community?I’m always thinking about that. Where do I belong? Just trying to understand the historical erasure of queer and trans people. Any sort of gender presentation or gender variant, anything outside of the nuclear family when I was growing up was not accepted.Having lived through that experience, there are some mediums that I’m drawn to. With photography I am able to build a whole world in one frame. I have one shot to try and deliver the message, the idea, I want to get across. That’s why there’s so much symbolism, little hints and cues.How important is it that people “get” the ideas you are trying to convey?You might need to be in a certain demographic to understand some of hints and get some of the messages. And I like that. I like that there are a lot of clues and that, if you’re someone who isn’t in one of those circles that I circulate through, you might not get it.I really work with this idea that not everything is for you.There is a lot of art out there that I don’t like and maybe I don’t get. But I respect it and appreciate it because we can’t just have one kind of art for us all. That’s the multitudes.What are your plans for the residency?One of the projects I will be working on has a soft title called Neglect.Sometimes we neglect ourselves for the greater good, other times we forget to take care of ourselves. And there’s an aspect of neglect with nostalgia and wanting to hold onto things but not really having the care or attention that needs to preserve them.For instance, I have a bunch of taxidermy that I’ve had for many years. I love it, but because I was so overworked, as a Frontline worker-activist at a native women’s shelter, and going to school full-time doing my graduate degree, moths ate this rabbit that I had.The other day I was cleaning out my medicine box where I keep all my tobacco and sage and other stuff. There was this whole bag of cedar that was rotten and I thought ‘Oh my god, this is perfect for my new project!’ Of course, my partner was saying ‘What the hell! That should go into the garbage.’ [Laughing] But I said no it needs to serve its purpose and then we can throw it out.It’s about having to say goodbye to things. You come to a point where you just have to bury some things and let them go because you can’t hold on to everything.What are your earliest memories of art?Art has been around me for as long as I can remember.When my little sister was born, I was relegated to the basement, and for me, the basement was full of scary stuff. I had a very active mind as a child.But my mom had a spot in the basement where she did her crafts, with a big fluorescent light under which she would make dream catchers and earrings. We’d go harvesting for red willow and a lot of the materials that she used. I’d watch her making these beautiful things.At night, I would beg my mom to come downstairs and craft because the fluorescent light coming through a crack made me feel safe because I knew she was there. And whatever my mind would conjure up, knowing she was there kept it at bay. Right from when I was very young, art gave me a feeling of safety.So, you were exposed to Indigenous art at a young age? Well, it’s interesting because we never really talked about that in our home. Ever. My mom was really just starting to lean into the culture because for a lot of my family of a certain generation, it wasn’t OK to be a native. Many had been harassed.That is such a common story for a lot of Métis people. There’s a lot of shame of being mixed. I think it’s a whole eugenics thing. You weren’t seen as having one bloodline, you were a half-breed.I’ve only just learned that my great grandmother used to bead and make her own shoes and mukluks. They were living on the farm, they were living on the land. It wasn’t really a farm it was kind of a haphazard farm. It was really just a farm to keep the family alive.So what does it look like when you, a Métis artist, rekindles that past and those traditions and bring them into your world view? Kandace Battle Axe, Kinship Masks, 2016, 60 x 75 inches, digital photographThat’s kind of what I’m doing with the beadwork [on leather fetish masks]. I was using a lot of black on black for a while because I really wanted it to be very covert and make people really look for the answer – if there was an answer.Traditionally, of course, [Indigenous bead workers] use a lot of colour. I went the complete opposite.We always talk about the dichotomy of tradition and contemporary. There is a legacy that I want to honour while asking how does that read now? How does it evolve and change? And part of that evolution is how I’m looking at it.It’s perfect me because I approached it kind of out of left field. And now I want to approach it more traditionally with floral patterns and representations.Of course, when you look at the beadwork it’s not just flowers. Those flowers are representations of people. That’s what I’m starting to uncover now in talking to other Metis bead workers. What are the symbols that we used?I remember Jamie Morse telling me about the oak leaf and how that was a way of showing a trading post. When you’re looking at some Métis beadwork you may be looking at a map of an area. It looks really pretty and beautiful but it actually shows you the way. How wonderful is that?Dayna Danger will deliver their first Artist’s Talk as Mellon Artist in Residence on February 21, at 2 p.m. The presentation will take place on Zoom.

New chapter for Indigenous Writer in Residence program,"Maya Cousineau-Mollen hopes to complete her third collection of poetry during her Residency at McGillMaya Cousineau-Mollen, an Innu-Montagnaise writer, is McGill’s Mellon Indigenous Writer in Residence for 2022. Encouraged by her adopted parents, Cousineau-Mollen began writing poetry at a young age and has since incorporated writing throughout her life. Cousineau-Mollen is the cofounder of the First Nations Youth Council in Quebec and Labrador, in addition to founding the association étudiante autochtone à l’Université Laval. Published in anthologies and literary reviews, Cousineau Mollen published her first collection of poetry with la maison d’Éditions Hannenorak titled: Bréviaire du Matricule 082.The Indigenous Writer in Residence program is one of the initiatives funded by the five-year US$1.25-million grant by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in June 2019 to support McGill’s Indigenous Studies and Community Engagement Initiative (ISCEI). The ISCEI promotes the growth of the Indigenous Studies Program in the Faculty of Arts, and aims to serve as a nexus for Indigenous scholarship and community-building and to facilitate communication and collaboration both across units at McGill, as well as in partnership with Indigenous communities.“We are very excited to have Maya be the Indigenous Writer in Residence because she brings with her a passion and connection to her community that is very unique and specific to the Cote Nord Region of Mingan,” says Terry Young, Program Manager, ISCEI. “It is also very exciting to have a Francophone writer in residence because she is able to share her stories and experiences in French which is allowing for ISCEI to work closely with both the English and French Departments by giving class presentations and working with student groups on campus. In the coming weeks Maya will be providing a public talk on her experiences and her recent works.”Maya Cousineau-Mollen will deliver her first lecture as Mellon Writer in Residence on February 23, at 2:30 p.m. The presentation will take place on Zoom in French. Registration is required.Recently, she spoke with the Reporter.You are the second ISCEI Writer in Residence. How important is it for McGill – and other institutions like McGill – to have initiatives like this?First of all, you should know that I didn’t apply – I didn’t even know this program existed. But I was so honoured to be chosen – what a joy! It is a wonderful initiative.Have you always been drawn toward poetry, even as a child?  No, when I was a kid, I was interested in reading – all kind of books. But in my period we didn’t have any role models as indigenous Writers.Do you remember when you first started writing? I was in 6th grade. I wrote a little tale of 6 or 7 pages. It was appreciated. After that I wrote a few science-fiction stories.I started to write poetry when I was in Secondary 4. In high school I took a poetry class and since then, I’ve been hooked.What is it about poetry that calls you or, conversely, what is it about you that is drawn to poetry?  Poetry is an outlet. Through it, I express what hurts me or makes me react strongly.Are there recurring themes or overarching topics in your work?Identity as an adoptee and Innu womenEldersLandMy parents (Innu and Québécois)Sensuality as a First Nation womanPainful events like the Oka Crisis, the Wet’suwet’en [land dispute], and missing and murdered womenColonization and The Indian actSecret loveYou are Innu by birth and were adopted by a “traditional” Quebecois family. How do these two realities inform your world view and your work?It gives me a unique point of view. I see the different challenges … we face as a nation. I use my poetry as a medium to share the teachings of our Indigenous history.Do you have any mentors or people who inspired you to follow this path? Any other writers in your family?My adopted dad, Pierre Cousineau, who pushed me to write and also Claude Picard, Wendat, who is the mentor for my career and a wonderful guide.Do you have a set schedule to write, with specific times of the day, or do you wait until you feel so inspired? No schedule really. I wait for inspiration.A writer of fiction sits down to write a specific story. How does it work when writing poetry? It’s when I hear shocking news, or I see something that touches me. So, I write on my iPhone.. like Lee Maracle [Indigenous Canadian writer and academic of the Sto꞉lo nation] used to do. May she rest in peace.Are you working on a new collection at present? Yes, it will be published in April! The name of my second collection of poetry is : Enfants du Lichen.Why is it important for people to read more Indigenous writers?It helps to know us better. People are more are interested in us and in our stories. They want to know more and walk with us on this new path that we are beginning.What do you hope to accomplish during your residency?I’d like to start my third book of poetry.Is there anything else you would like to add?Just a big Thinashkumitin for this tremendous opportunity!Maya Cousineau-Mollen will deliver her first lecture as Mellon Writer in Residence on February 23, at 2:30 p.m. The presentation will take place on Zoom in French. Registration is required.","Tue, 02/15/2022 - 14:43"
McGill welcomes new Indigenous professors and staff,"Recent Indigenous faculty and staff hires, top row (l to r): Joshua Nichols and Brittany Wenniserí:iostha Jock. Middle row (l to r): Terry Young, George Kennedy and Matthew Coutu-Moya. Bottom row (l to r): Vanessa Racine and Lance LamoreThe fourth edition of the Indigenous Faculty and Staff Welcome Ceremony, held on February 14, welcomed seven new Indigenous staff members from a wide range of disciplines, including law, social work, and agricultural and environmental sciences. The 90-minute online ceremony was designed to highlight the University’s commitment to increasing the Indigenous presence on campus.The seven new McGillians are:Mathew Coutu-Moya (Indigenous Access McGill Coordinator, School of Social Work)Brittany Wenniserí:iostha Jock (Assistant Professor, Faculty of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences: School of Human Nutrition)George Kennedy (Faculty Lecturer, School of Continuing Studies)Lance Lamore (Indigenous Counsellor, Wellness Hub, Student Services)Joshua Nichols (Assistant Professor, Faculty of Law)Vanessa Racine (Administrative Coordinator, Indigenous Studies and Community Engagement Initiative (ISCEI))Terry Young (Student Advisor, First Peoples’ House. Currently on developmental assignment with ISCEI)The three new professors and four staff members were formally welcomed by Provost Christopher Manfredi, who noted the Indigenous community among faculty and staff at McGill has now grown to 31 members – 10 staff, and 21 faculty from several nations, Métis and Inuit people.“Although the number is small, we hope that through regular contact with our Indigenous Initiatives units every three months for the quarterly updates, as well as the activities of the Indigenous caucus, that you will feel a sense of community with other Indigenous faculty and staff,” Manfredi said.The Provost also reiterated McGill’s commitment toward reconciliation, though he acknowledged the changes we wish to see happen don’t always occur fast enough or go far enough.“We are working hard on those 52 Calls to Action.” Manfredi said. “As the Indigenous community at McGill grows, it would be an opportunity for us to have an in-depth exchange about those calls to action…and I very much will welcome your thoughts about how we should prioritize those calls.”In its 2017 Final Report, the Provost’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education called upon the University to set a target of appointing at least 35 Indigenous tenure-track or tenured professors by 2032.Giving thanks to natureKahnawake elder Charlie Otsi’tsaken:ra Patton opened the ceremony with the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Thanksgiving Address.“The Haudenosaunee people, our Elders, have taught us that, whenever people gather for any occasion, the first thing that we acknowledge are the forces that have given us life at this time and continue to support us into the future,” he said. “This ceremony has been done since the beginning of time and its purpose is to remind all those listening to never forget to be thankful for all that is in place to help us accomplish the work at hand using a good mind.”He was joined by another Kahnawake Elder, Kevin Ka’nahsóhon Deer, who shared a message about the importance of relationships – particularly that which we have to the natural world.“We are all at a point in history where we all better start to see different,” he said. “We all better start to hear different. In 1990, a group of scientists got together. They said we’re now approaching the Anthropocene, which essentially means human extinction. Because everything is out of whack, and if it’s going to take Mother Earth 4.5 billion years to rewrite everything again in perfect harmony and balance, so be it. She’s got all the time in the world. We don’t.”The importance of Indigenous voicesAlex McComber, an assistant professor at the Department of Family Medicine, who was welcomed in last year’s ceremony, joined this year’s honourees to lend his support – and to reiterate the importance of bringing Indigenous ways of life into teaching and research, and to create a space where those voices are respected and honoured.“We carry this responsibility to make this place healthy and strong for my grandchildren, and their grandchildren, and all our future brothers and sisters coming into this place, that they come into safe places, places of power where our respect among all peoples is evident,” McComber said.","Tue, 02/15/2022 - 14:35"
McGill named one of Montreal’s top employers once again,"For the 14th straight year, McGill University has been listed as one of Montreal’s Top Employers.The annual competition is organized by Mediacorp Canada Inc., the editors of Canada’s Top 100 Employers, to recognize the employers in Greater Montreal that lead their industries in offering exceptional places to work. This year’s winners were announced this morning, Feb. 15, with a special magazine insert in the Montreal Gazette.For Diana Dutton, Associate Vice-Principal, Human Resources, the recognition of McGill as one of Montreal’s top employers reflects the University’s commitment to its employees.“Our employees are our most important asset,” Dutton says. “McGill University is committed to supporting employee health and wellbeing through our policies and programs, and this has been an even more important focus for us during the pandemic.  We believe that if our employees feel supported, they will be more engaged and connected, and that leads to better outcomes for everyone involved.”Benefits, employee support cited The criteria used during the selection process focuses on physical workplace; work atmosphere; health, financial and family benefits; vacation and time off; employee communications; performance management; training and skills development; and community involvement. Employers are compared to other organizations in their field to determine which offer the most progressive and forward-thinking programs.McGill earned high praise for its programs to facilitate the balance between work and home life – including for new mothers. In addition to its maternity leave top-up payments for new mothers – to 100 percent of salary for 20 weeks – the University makes it easier for new mothers to return to work with onsite child care options, as well as the option to extend their leave into an unpaid leave of absence.McGill was also cited for its flexible work hours for employees, a 35-hour work week, and reduced summer hours. The University “encourages employees to take time off to recharge with three weeks of starting vacation allowance, moving to four weeks after only three years on the job,” the Top Employers citation said. “Additionally, the organization offers paid time off during the summer and winter months, as well as paid personal days that can be scheduled throughout the year.”Prioritizing employee health and well-being The University also earned top marks for maintaining an internal health and well-being program for employees “which features resources, tools and strategies to help employees adopt and sustain positive mental, physical, financial and nutritional health and social connection.” As part of the health benefits plan, employees can access a mental health coverage benefit of up to $2,000 annually – increased from $1,000 on July 1, 2021.Meanwhile, Mediacorp also noted McGill’s ability to adapt to changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, including its webinars and online workshops on topics such as mental health, and transitioning to remote working.Find out more about Montreal’s Top Employers.","Tue, 02/15/2022 - 14:18"
"Lifting of COVID restrictions, return of staff, emergency response transition, and transmission in residences / Levée des restrictions liées à la COVID-19, retour du personnel, transfert de la gestion pandémique et transmission dans les résidences","Staff | 11 Feb 2022            EOC updates Add to calendarFacebookLinkedInTweet Widget This message is sent on behalf of Fabrice Labeau, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) on behalf of the Emergency Operations Centre.Le présent message est envoyé au nom de Fabrice Labeau, premier vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Études et vie étudiante), au nom du Centre des opérations d’urgence (COU).La version française suit. Dear members of the McGill community,On Tuesday, Premier Francois Legault announced Quebec’s plan to gradually lift many COVID related restrictions by mid-March. With more opportunities to connect with others in-person, we expect anyone who has not received their booster dose to make an appointment or visit a walk-in clinic today.In response, McGill will also continue to gradually lift restrictions, following the government’s recommendations. Here’s what is changing:1) Progressive return for all Administrative & Support staffAs of February 28, all Administrative & Support staff are expected to be on campus for a minimum of 30% of their time. This percentage will increase progressively in the following weeks. Of course, local needs may require staff to be on campus more often.Further details regarding the timeline for the progressive return of staff will be provided in the coming weeks.2) Athletics and Extracurricular activities The loosening of restrictions means increased opportunities for getting exercise and getting back to some non-academic activities at McGill.Gyms will reopen on February 14We currently plan to have in-person extracurriculars resume on February 283) Transition from Emergency Operations Centre to Recovery and Operations ResumptionsWith Quebec reopening, McGill is moving back to a less centralized COVID response.The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) had been reactivated at the end of the Fall 2021 semester to deal with the rapidly evolving Omicron situation. Starting Monday, McGill will move its pandemic response from EOC back to the Recovery and Operations Resumption committee (ROR). ROR will allow for a smooth transition to our regular governance processes as the pandemic evolves.The responsibility for McGill’s COVID response had previously transitioned from EOC to ROR during the Fall semester and more information is available here.Please watch this short video, where Christopher Buddle, Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs), explains how the University’s COVID response is evolving.Although restrictions are loosening, the pandemic is not over, and we will continue to see some cases.Five students have tested positive in a student residence. The Case Management Group has determined that transmission likely happened within the residence between two roommates, and also between two people who attended a social gathering. An email is being sent to residence students asking those who may have been in contact to get a rapid test at the residence rapid testing centres.We still need to maintain many safety precautions, including masks, distancing measures, and in certain circumstances, the vaccine passport.We thank all of you for your efforts to keep our community safe during our return of more in-person activities this winter, and I look forward to seeing more of you on campus, in-person, over the coming weeks.Sincerely,Fabrice Labeau		Deputy Provost (Student Life & Learning)  Chers membres de la communauté mcgilloise,Mardi dernier, le premier ministre François Legault a annoncé le plan provincial visant à lever graduellement l’essentiel des restrictions en lien avec la COVID-19 d’ici la mi-mars. Étant donné la multiplication des contacts en personne qui en résultera, nous incitons tous ceux qui ne l’ont pas déjà fait à prendre rendez-vous ou à se présenter dans une clinique sans rendez-vous pour obtenir leur dose de rappel immédiatement.L’Université McGill continuera elle aussi à lever graduellement ses restrictions, conformément aux recommandations gouvernementales. Voici un aperçu des changements à venir :1) Retour progressif du personnel administratif et de soutienÀ compter du 28 février, tous les membres du personnel administratif et de soutien devront effectuer au moins 30 % de leurs heures de travail sur le campus. Ce pourcentage augmentera progressivement au cours des semaines suivantes. Il se pourrait, bien sûr, qu’en raison des besoins locaux, le personnel doive effectuer un pourcentage plus important de ses heures de travail sur le campus.Nous vous transmettrons d’autres renseignements au sujet du calendrier de retour progressif du personnel au cours des prochaines semaines.2) Activités sportives et para-universitairesL’assouplissement des restrictions nous permet de reprendre nos activités sportives ainsi que certaines activités non universitaires sur le campus.Les gymnases rouvriront le 14 février.À l’heure actuelle, nous prévoyons la reprise des activités para-universitaires en personne pour le 28 février. 3) Transition du Centre des opérations d’urgence au Comité de la reprise des activités et du retourÀ l’approche du déconfinement au Québec, l’Université revient à un mode de gestion décentralisé de la COVID-19.Le Centre des opérations d’urgence (COU) avait été remis en service à la fin de la session d’automne 2021 pour faire face à la propagation fulgurante du variant Omicron. Dès lundi, McGill confiera de nouveau la gestion de la pandémie au Comité de la reprise des activités et du retour (RAR). Au fur et à mesure que la situation pandémique se stabilisera, le RAR assurera un retour graduel vers nos processus de gouvernance habituels.À la session d’automne, nous avions déjà transféré la gestion de la situation liée à la COVID-19 du COU au Comité RAR. Vous trouverez de plus amples renseignements à ce sujet ici.Je vous invite à visionner cette courte vidéo, dans laquelle Christopher Buddle, vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Enseignement et programmes d’études), nous parle de l’évolution des mesures adoptées par l’Université pour lutter contre la COVID-19.Les restrictions s’assouplissent, mais la pandémie n’est pas terminée et nous verrons encore des cas se déclarer.Cinq étudiants ont reçu un diagnostic positif de COVID-19. Selon le Groupe de gestion des cas, la transmission a probablement eu lieu à l’intérieur de la résidence, entre deux colocataires, ainsi qu’entre deux personnes qui ont participé à un rassemblement social. Les étudiants habitant en résidence recevront un courriel demandant à ceux qui ont potentiellement été exposés d’aller passer un test de dépistage rapide à l’un des centres de dépistage rapide des résidences.Il est important de garder en place plusieurs précautions, notamment le port du masque, la distanciation et, dans certains contextes, l’exigence du passeport vaccinal.Nous vous remercions pour tous les efforts déployés en faveur de la sécurité de notre communauté en cette période de retour aux activités en personne. Je suis impatient de vous revoir sur le campus au cours des prochaines semaines.Sincères salutations,Fabrice LabeauPremier vice-principal exécutif adjoint (Études et vie étudiante)","Fri, 02/11/2022 - 16:30"
Drawing the future of Mac campus,"Two of the seven panels created by illustrator Jordana Globerman (BA’11) that tell the story of Mac’s past, present and visions for the futureEach February, the Macdonald campus community gathers to mark Founder’s Day, a birthday celebration for Sir William C. Macdonald (1831–1917), who founded Macdonald College in 1907. The celebration is always held on the Thursday closest to the anniversary of Sir William’s birth, February 10; this year’s Founder’s Day happened to fall right on the actual day.Last year’s MC, Professor Murray Humphries, McGill Northern Research Chair, returned to the virtual podium as 2022 host. He noted that Founder’s Day “is not necessarily a celebration of a single man, but rather of his vision for what was possible and the catalyst for everything that’s followed. It’s about growth and learning and vision that changes and evolves over time.”“This year, we’ve reached out to our campus community and received valuable feedback about the future and who we are and where we’re going, and who’s included and impacted by the work we do at this campus,” continued Humphries. “So our hope is that this isn’t a one-day event, but rather the beginning of an ongoing dialogue amongst community members about how we continuously improve who we are and what we do.”Shared responsibilityHumphries noted that the Mac campus is on Haudenosaunee territory, so it was appropriate that the ceremony proper began with words from across the river in Kahnawá:ke. Kanien’kéha elder Amelia McGregor offered the Ohénton Karihwatéhkwen (“the words that come before all else”), a reminder of everyone’s shared responsibility to the ecosystem and the sustaining spirit of creation.McGregor was joined by Mac professor Treena Wasonti:io Delormier, Associate Director of the Center for Indigenous Peoples’ Nutrition and Environment and the Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Indigenous Peoples’ Nutrition and Food Sovereignty. The two women have collaborated on in-community research projects since 1994, including the Kahnawá:ke Schools Diabetes Prevention Program, which Wasonti:io Delormier said “has served as a model for how to do partnership research with Indigenous communities. A lot of how we operate is rooted in Haudenosaunee values, principles and lessons to figure out how best to make decisions and partnerships. And how do we continue to learn from those. We’re still learning. We just recently had a discussion about how do we integrate ceremony, meaningfully and respectfully, into research.”Multiple milestonesSir William C. Macdonald founded Macdonald College in 1907In addition to marking Sir William Macdonald’s 192nd birthday, this year also marked the last Founder’s Day for Bruce D. Bolton (BSc’72) in his official, longstanding capacity as executive director of the Macdonald Stewart Foundation.  The Foundation continues the philanthropic tradition of Sir William Macdonald and his heirs, the Stewart family.“It’s a sincere thanks from the Macdonald campus community to Bruce Bolton and the Macdonald Stewart Foundation for all the support that they’ve shown to our campus over the years,” said Humphries. He also took a moment to welcome the Foundation’s new associate executive director, Thomas Leslie (LMus’06).Although Bolton joined the virtual celebrations from Florida, he was a fixture at in-person Founder’s Days, always decked out in tartan and brandishing his trusty bagpipes.“The times that we have shared on Founder’s Day will be among the most memorable of my career simply because I have had the privilege to be piped into the room by Bruce Bolton,” recalled Anja Geitmann, Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. “Thank you to Bruce, for not only the many years of service for the Foundation, but for the many things that you have done for this campus and for creating this particularly special memory.”Drawing the futureAs part of McGill’s Bicentennial year, the 2022 Founder’s Day took on a graphic twist—literally.In the week’s leading up to the big day, McGill students, faculty and staff were asked to share their feelings about the campus.  What’s their favourite thing about Mac? How would they describe Mac in one word? In one colour? One emotion? How do they hope to see the Macdonald campus, and the work being done there, evolve over the next 50 years and beyond?Illustrator Jordana Globerman (BA’11) synthesized those ideas into seven dynamic, vibrant panels that tell the story of Mac’s past, present and visions for the future. Globerman unveiled her artwork—including the four future-focused panels that she drew in an interactive real-time Zoom performance on Thursday morning—at the event.“I was blown away by the input,” said Globerman, an Ottawa-based visual storyteller.  “There were so many great ideas, and so much engagement throughout the morning. It’s really nice to see that there’s quite a close-knit community at Macdonald.”The panels are still a work in progress. Plans are underway to permanently display Globerman’s final artwork on campus, possibly in the hallway connecting the Macdonald Stewart and Raymond Buildings.A vision for hands-on learning“How do we get from a single person to an entire campus with thousands of students?” asked Geitmann. “Our founder’s vision is bigger than the founder.”Dean Geitmann outlined the broad strokes of Macdonald’s biography. Wealthy industrialist. Generous benefactor. Fourth chancellor of McGill. Big champion of the University’s law, engineering, physics and architecture departments in the 1890s and early 1900s. Helped set up McGill’s first student recreation facility, in the building that is now home to the McCord Museum.“All of this was, of course, on the downtown campus,” Geitmann noted. “How did we get from this passion for education to a campus at Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue? Such a vision doesn’t just get created overnight, right? You don’t go to sleep and wake up the next morning with the idea to set up a huge campus.”The catalyst was cheese. Specifically, James Wilson Robertson, a cheese manufacturer, educator and civil servant.“Robertson was fascinated by the fact that the quality of food dependent on several factors,” explained Geitmann, “and these included but not only the cheese maker, but the quality of the milk. And the quality of milk, of course, depends on the health of the cow. And the health of the cow depends on the quality of the fodder. And the fodder, of course, depends on the richness of the soil. So he very much saw that interlinkage between the soil, the animal health, and the eventual outcome.”Better crops through scienceSir Macdonald met Robertson around 1897, “probably on an experimental farm in Ottawa.” The two shared an interest in educational reform, especially in rural areas. To spur children’s interest in agriculture, Robertson and Macdonald partnered in an annual agricultural competition to reward children who grew the highest-quality seed grain.“After several years, the final seeds were actually 20 per cent bigger than the initial seeds,” said Geitmann. “So through this competition, they illustrated the cuts of crops could be bred through systematic selection. And they didn’t only do that in a research, scientific way, but they did it through the involvement of the general public, and more importantly, through children. So it was very inspired.”Buoyed by this success, and taking further inspiration from schools in Britain and Sweden, Macdonald and Robertson established a program of manual training workshops for boys and girls, and consolidated small schoolhouses into larger schools with multiple teachers teaching several disciplines. Macdonald purchased several farms on the western tip of Montreal to create a contiguous plot of land to house one such large school: Macdonald College, which taught agriculture, household sciences, and teaching.(For a full history of the Mac campus, see its Bicentennial timeline.)“What was really important at the time was the dedication to hands-on learning,” noted Geitmann, “and that’s a dedication we have today as well: to make learning an experience that goes beyond the classroom. And that gives students the experience that they need in order to get a real job later on. So that vision that was started more than 100 years ago is ongoing. We’re continuously building the campus, we’re continuously building the programs, and that is something that is truly integral to an educational institution, and in particular, to Macdonald campus.”Nancy Lavigne: A force of natureFor many years, Paul Meldrum, the Macdonald Campus Farm Manager, brought his affable wit (and, yes, kilt) to his duties as Founder’s Day master of ceremonies. With his retirement just a few short months away, Meldrum returned to the Founder’s Day podium to present the Macdonald Campus Award of Excellence for Administrative and Support Staff to a cherished colleague: Nancy Lavigne.Nancy Lavigne was named winner of the Macdonald Campus Award of Excellence for Administrative and Support StaffFor the past 24 years, Lavigne has worked diligently and tirelessly as Administrator of the Macdonald Campus Farm. (As Meldrum noted, this was prefaced with almost 14 years in other capacities at McGill, including six years with Printing Services and another six years “in charge of conferences and special events and alcoholic beverage control.”) The experimental and demonstration farm spans 205 hectares, so keeping such a large endeavour running requires Lavigne to coordinate among a wide variety of players and departments: professors, researchers, students, facilities tradespeople, University administration, farm staff, and a seasonal army of 50 student casual workers.Lavigne also facilities the many requests for public tours, and was instrumental in developing the tour curriculum, hiring and training tour guides, and promoting and booking tours—a busy role that will only get busier with the opening of the forthcoming Macdonald Farm Community Engagement Centre.“Nancy is the first person that you meet when you ask for anything of the farm,” said Meldrum. “There are many requests of the farm, and Nancy answers all those requests, not just as part of her duty, but with a smile and with exuberance.”“When Nancy throws herself into a job, it is full bore,” he continued. “When we did open houses with the UPA [Union des producteurs agricoles] and with the town of Sainte-Anne, she was in there like a dirty shirt. When we took on more departments at the farm, the Lods [Agronomy Research Centre] and the Horticulture Centre, she helped make that transition easy. When we reimplemented the educational tours, it was Nancy who canvassed all the schools and the school boards in the greater Montreal area, developed a pamphlet, had the photography done, went to a printer, mailed out all those pamphlets, year after year—and she coerced the Milk Producers Federation into giving free chocolate milk!“There’s no halfway with Nancy. It’s go big or go home.”Gold Key recipientsNext, it was time to honour six Mac students with Gold Key Awards. The Award is given out by the Macdonald Branch of the McGill Alumni Association to students in recognition of leadership and excellence in the promotion and development of extracurricular activities. Laura Wittebol, one of two Gold Key Committee Co-Chairs, presented the 2022 awards.This year’s Gold Key recipients are:Antoine Bouvier (Bioresource Engineering, U3): Eager to share his passion for 3D printing with the Macdonald community, Bouvier revived and expanded the Mac 3D Printing Club to become a viable and forward-looking venture, showing an entrepreneurial spirit which now benefits many students and clubs at Macdonald campus.Sean Clarke (Bioresource Engineering, U3): Resourceful and creative in his roles as VP Finance in the Bioresource Engineering Students’ Society and the Macdonald Campus Student Society, Clarke has found ways to increase funding for student projects and clubs, while also improving accessibility and equity in its allocation, to the benefit of all Macdonald students.Chloe Garzon (Human Nutrition, U3): A compassionate and considerate leader, Garzon is the proud president of both the Macdonald Bring Your Own Bulk group and the Macdonald Campus Student Society. These opportunities allow her to engage with students, clubs, and societies on our campus and help them to flourish. She also enjoys her work as Tomlinson Engagement Award Member (TEAM) in Organic Chemistry, where she helps students by using innovative learning methods.Anthony Iheonye (PhD candidate, Bioresource Engineering): Winner of the Macdonald Campus 3MT Competition in 2019, Iheonye has continued to work with the Lister Family Foundation and Teaching and Learning Services to help students with their communication skills. As an International Student Buddy, he advises new students and helps them integrate at Mac. For MCGSS, he has worked to help engage all graduate students by organizing events including Graduate Orientation and other social activities.Krisztina Mosdossy (PhD candidate, Natural Resource Sciences): Visionary and inspiring, Mosdossy works to engage her fellow students at Macdonald campus with their environment, relating to agriculture, social equity, and sustainability. She does this through her active involvement in the Macdonald Permaculture Showcase Garden, the Women+ in Science group, and the Sustainability of Operations at Macdonald Campus Task Force.Sharvani Ram (Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry, U3): A cognizant community leader, Ram has been involved in many campus-wide groups and initiatives, where her passion in fostering a sense of community and student engagement at Macdonald Campus is strongly evident. She is especially proud of her work as President of the Dietetics Human Nutrition Undergraduate Society, where she has worked to develop a peer-led mentorship program and panel discussions to raise awareness about competencies and cultural humility.","Fri, 02/11/2022 - 10:44"

Black artists on surviving – and thriving – in the music industry,"The Navigating Spaces panel, top row (l to r): Moderator Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo, Sarah MK and Koudjo. Bottom row (l to r): Modibo Keita and Camille ThurmanBlacks aspiring to make a career in music face a number of challenges, from their earliest forays into music as children and extending throughout their musical journey as adults. This was one of the takeaways of the panel discussion Black Perspectives: Artists Navigating Spaces on February 9.However, panelists agreed that many obstacles facing Black musicians can be overcome, even circumvented, through mentorship, community connections and for Black artists and entrepreneurs to take literal ownership of their creative destinies.Accessibility is a major hurdle for many Blacks when it comes to early exploration in music. “I came from the inner city [New York] where, in my neighbourhood, we didn’t have arts programs,” said Camille Thurman, an acclaimed jazz vocalist and saxophonist and an assistant professor of Jazz in the Schulich School of Music’s Department of Music Performance. “I literally got shipped across town an hour away to take music lessons.”Thurman said even owning an instrument was something “my mother had to figure out, being a single parent.”Always catching upSeveral of the panelists, all accomplished artists or music entrepreneurs, spoke about feelings of always being behind.“I’ve experienced this myself as a student where you get to the audition and the person is asking you to do something that you don’t understand – such and such a technique,” said Thurman. “The student feels ashamed because they don’t know – but they never even had a chance because they didn’t even get the tools to be able to achieve success.”“A lot of times children are already disenfranchised from having access to the arts just based on their ZIP Code.”“If we’re going have institutions where we bring people into addition, it is essential that we make those connections to the community, where there are programs that [offer] free access to music lessons, free programs in the summer.”Sarah MK, a Montreal singer-songwriter, was pursuing health sciences when she decided to apply to the Vanier College Music Department as a vocalist. She aced the audition but struggled with the technical aspects of music. “I remember doing the theory test and just writing my name and leaving,” she said with a smile. “I was lucky enough to have remedial classes in the summertime and catch up. I’m always catching up.”Diversity, communityThese feelings of being behind are not as prevalent in certain local music collectives where collaboration and community are cornerstones to creating great music.Sarah MK was one of the earliest members of the Kalmunity Vibe Collective, billed as “Canada’s largest and longest running improv collective best known for producing multiple weekly concerts.”Kalmunity’s strength is its diversity. “Kalmunity really allowed us to connect with all the different cultures in Montreal,” said Sarah MK. “It also connected English and French and vocal artists and musicians. There were some musicians who were graduates from McGill and others who were self-taught. It’s a really beautiful place to meet up and create music together,” she said.“I started going to Kalmunity when I was super young, probably about 12 or 13,” says Keita. “At that time, I didn’t even know that I was going to pursue a music career. I just knew that I liked playing music and these guys were playing on Tuesdays. Some of these people became my mentors over the years because I used to play next to them all the time and they would give me tips.”Thanks in part to that mentorship, Keita honed his skills and gained confidence, playing at local events with Kalmunity, then touring with them, and, finally, collaborating with an ever-widening network of musicians. “I connected with people who allowed me to grow as a musician into the musician that I am today,” he said. “Mentorship is one of the most important factors – not only for music, but for anything in life.”Connecting the dotsThese collective experiences, with the emphasis on community and peer-support, are invaluable in the growth of the artist.“When I was in university I was the person in my program who started the latest playing my instrument – and I started playing at 13. Some of these kids had started when they were four years old. They had been put into programs with some of the best jazz musicians in the country teaching them,” said,” said Keita. “Of course, when they get to university they’re killing it – and I’m just running to catch up to them.“But the thing I had over them was I had this community that mentored me,” he said. “Your proficiency on an instrument isn’t really what gets you to bloom in the musical realm. What really makes you bloom is your ability to connect all the dots.”Jazz ‘is about a way of living, a way of being’‘Connecting all the dots’ is what Thurman would call the communal life of music – especially Jazz – a core aspect that is often inadvertently stripped away in an institutional setting.“There is a disconnect a between where this music came from, this source – which is the community – and the institution. In one sense, the institution has created a space for the music to keep going. But at the same time, it has shifted the element of it being directly involved in the community,” said Thurman.“When we talk about learning jazz, it is deeply rooted in the tradition of mentorship, and listening, and watching, and being in the moment, and learning how to work together. How do we survive in the moment?” she said.“This is something that is beyond just a fact, beyond just a simple scale, and beyond just being able to repeat something and execute it perfectly every time,” said Thurman. “This music is about a function. It is about a way of living and a way of being.”Circumvent the systemOften, the best way to circumvent these obstacles is for Black artists and entrepreneurs to establish their own spaces within which to create and promote their art.“With urban music or Hip Hop, a lot of the artists are from Black heritage, Black culture. But the people who are working in the offices, making the decisions and deploying the capital are not Black,” said Koudjo, a music producer and an entrepreneur, who came to Montreal from his native Togo in 2000 to study economics at McGill. “Same thing in the media. Sometimes [there are people who] don’t even know the culture who are making decisions to play this music or that music, or to give access to this artist or that one. That was one of the main complaints I used to hear from artists.”In 2018, with almost no Black-owned media outlets covering hip hop or rap, Koudjo co-founded QCLTUR (pronounced culture), a Montreal-based media platform that promotes arts and the culture. Much of the content being produced by QCLTUR are interviews of artists that are broadcast on social media.Control the message, broaden the fan base“The main goal was to promote Black culture and the culture that we consume,” said Koudjo. “And we want to make sure that the narrative of that culture is aligned with the culture [itself] – because there was a big disconnect from the artists that were big and selling music and packing concerts here in Montreal and the coverage that they had in mainstream media.”QCLTUR’s success has not only helped increase exposure of Black artists among existing fans, it has helped grow the base.“It allows us to be in spaces where we weren’t welcome three or four years ago,” says Koudjo. “This summer we were booked at Osheaga. We got to bring 23 artists with us on stage which is crazy because 95 per cent of them would never have had a chance to perform at Osheaga.”","Thu, 02/10/2022 - 19:17"
Microplastics and the environment,"Microplastics and nanoplastics are being found in natural waters, oceans, rivers, sediment, on farms and in the air.As vehicles drive on roads, their tires release small particles. Clothing made from synthetic fibres such as polyester, acrylic and nylon, release small fibers through everyday wear and washing. Even though you can’t see many of them, microplastics flow into the environment every day.In the environment, plastic just keeps breaking down into smaller pieces of plastic: first, what’s known as microplastics, and then nanoplastics.Nathalie Tufenkji is the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Biocolloids and Surfaces /  Eva Blue“Some microplastics can be seen by the naked eye, but smaller microplastics can only be seen using a microscope,” says chemical engineering professor Nathalie Tufenkji, Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Biocolloids and Surfaces. “They can range from a few millimetres in size to a few micrometres [0.001 of a millimetre]. And if one microplastic breaks down into nanoplastics, you could end up with millions or billions of nanoplastics.” Down the drainSynthetic material that goes down our sinks, toilets and shower drains can break down and potentially release microplastics into the wastewater pipeline. Although water treatment facilities remove some of these particles, microplastics and nanoplastics are nonetheless being found in natural waters, oceans, rivers, sediment, on farms and in the air.Wastewater is not the only source of microplastics. Some fragile plastic goods in our houses break down and make their way into our drains, too.“We know that [even some] bulk products can break down into microplastics,” shares Tufenkji. “Studies investigating microplastics in wastewater are finding quite a bit of polyethylene.”Tufenkji and her team are making great strides in removing microplastics and nanoplastics from wastewater. In 2020, they ran successful simulations wastewater treatment, removing 97 per cent of polyester and 99 per cent of weathered polyethylene fibers.Still, there is much progress to be made in understanding the harm they cause, and how to prevent their release into the environment. Specifically, Tufenkji says we need to better understand:How does the human body process these chemicals, particles and material?What is the potential effect of these diverse particles?How does shape and size influence their effects?Do the additives have different health effects?Do we just eliminate these microplastics when we go to the bathroom?“One of the challenges with plastics is that they’re made of carbon,” says Tufenkji. “There is [already] a lot of carbon in soil. So when we’re looking for microplastics or nanoplastics in the environment, it’s not like looking for a needle in a haystack—it’s like looking for a specific piece of hay in a haystack.”“When we have better techniques and technologies that allow us to detect microplastics and nanoplastics in different environments, then we can address some of these questions.”Masks and winterSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, improperly discarded face masks have become a common sight on sidewalks and roads. To explore whether cycles of freezing and thawing expedite the release of microplastics, Tufenkji’s team exposed masks to water and simulated sunlight to the masks. They found that masks give off “a lot of plastic fibers.”With an estimated 129 billion masks and 65 billion gloves used per month across the globe, Professor Tufenkji argues that we need to be very careful with our mask disposal to avoid a wave of microplastics entering our environment.“We are not sure of the impacts, but it is clearly an undesirable scenario,” says Professor Tufenkji.“At the end of the day, reducing microplastics at the source is a priority,” says Prof. Tufenkji. “One relatively easy thing to implement is to reduce the use of single-use plastics. You can just imagine the number of single-use plastic bags, the number of single-use bottles, single-use plastic cutlery and plastic wrapping. I think that is something Canadians can do now to help protect their own environment,” says Tufenkji.To help Canadians make better choices, Tufenkji is one of several scientists who has teamed up with Ocean Diagnostics, a B.C. environmental impact company that is developing new techniques and technologies to help scientists detect microplastics, on its current public awareness campaign about what microplastics are and where they come from, how they affect our environments and communities, and what the public can do about it.“We are moving in the right direction,” she says of the global fight against plastic pollution. “There is a lot of research being done… In the next decade we are going to see the emergence of new materials and new technologies to help us deal with plastic pollution. We are also seeing a shift in customer behaviour and consumer interest in the problem. I am optimistic that we are going to see improvements with respect to scaling back plastic pollution.”","Thu, 02/10/2022 - 12:56"
February 11: International Day of Women and Girls in Science,"In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly declared February 11 as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. The day is celebrated around the world as a time to promote full and equal access to, and participation in, science for women and girls.Unfortunately, full and equal access is a goal at the moment, not the reality.“Today, only one in three science and engineering researchers in the world is a woman,” said António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations in a statement. “Structural and societal barriers prevent women and girls from entering and advancing in science…. This inequality is depriving our world of enormous untapped talent and innovation. We need women’s perspectives to make sure science and technology work for everyone.”“I taught engineering. I know from personal experience that young women and men are equally capable and equally fascinated by science, brimming with ideas, and ready to carry our world forward,” said Guterres. “On this International Day of Women and Girls in Science, I call on everyone to create an environment where women can realize their true potential and today’s girls become tomorrow’s leading scientists and innovators, shaping a fair and sustainable future for all.”World-renowned leaders in their fieldThere is no shortage of women in science playing critical roles at McGill, beginning with Principal Suzanne Fortier, a crystallographer by training. The University boasts long-standing, world-renowned researchers like Brenda Milner, Vicky Kaspi, Nitika Pant Pai, Catherine Potvin, Elena Bennett, Joëlle Pineau, Doina Precup and Audrey Moores. But early-career researchers such as Anna Weinberg, Daryl Haggard, Erica Moodie, and Jennifer Sunday are already making names for themselves in their respective fields.Then, of course, there are the students. McGill is the university of choice for a plethora of young women pursuing their studies in STEM. One need look no further than the recent announcement of the McCall MacBain Scholarships. Of McGill’s nine finalists, five are women with backgrounds in science and whose academic interests include everything from dentistry and microbiology, to engineering and medicine.The trail for today’s researchers had been blazed long ago. We recently profiled Ingrid Birker, Science Outreach Administrator at the Redpath Museum. On top of her duties at the Redpath, Birker has written articles for the Reporter, including profiles of some of McGill’s pioneers:Harriet Brooks, Canada’s first female nuclear physicist.Carrie Derick, Canada’s first woman geneticistMaude Abbott, cardiac pathologist, physician and curatorAlice Elizabeth Johannsen, educator and conservationistThe 2021 – 2022 academic year has proven to be a busy one for McGill’s female science students and researchers. It started off on an auspicious note when four women were among six recipients of Schulich Leader Scholarships, Canada’s largest STEM scholarship program.Here are just some of the highlights of the past six months:SeptemberCatherine Potvin, Canada Research Chair in Climate Change Mitigation and Tropical Forest, was named the 2021 recipient of the RSC’s prestigious Sir John William Dawson Medal for her significant interdisciplinary research in conservation biology, social-ecology, policy, and the arts.

Testing common drugs for a rare disease,"The Clinical Research Unit at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) aims to make all rare diseases treatable, expanding the range of investigational treatments offered to those who often have no other options to manage their disease. Adding new disease indications is important to reaching this goal, which is why the CRU is pleased to announce that the first ever clinical trial at The Neuro for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is underway. And surprisingly, the trial will study how a combination of three commonly used medications could potentially slow the progression of this rare disease.Despite being more prevalent in Canada than either Cystic Fibrosis or Myasthenia Gravis, CMT remains lesser known. According to the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation of Canada, CMT affects one out of every 2,500 people. It is an inherited peripheral neuropathy, meaning that it affects the nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal cord and extend to the feet and hands. These nerves have trouble sending signals to and from the brain, which results in numbness, weakness and loss of fine motor skills as muscles deteriorate. Individuals may require orthotics and braces, physical and occupational therapies as well as surgery to maintain their quality of life. There is currently no treatment or cure for CMT.Too much of a good thing“There are multiple types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). It is an umbrella term that signifies you have an inherited neuropathy that affects both motor and sensory nerve fibres,” says Dr. Rami Massie, a neurologist and one of the principal investigators for neuromuscular trials at the CRU.Dr. Rami MassieCMT is characterized according to its effect on axons, the long strands that connect nerve cells. In the most common type, CMT1, the disease affects the protective myelin sheath that surrounds the axon. In a second type, CMT2, the axon itself is affected. More than 100 genes have been linked to CMT, which makes it that much more difficult to find a treatment that will be effective for all CMT patients.“While there is only one type of mutation involved with CMT1A, what is surprising is that there are different phenotypes – that is, the disease can present with different severities and progresses at different rates. Some people won’t notice symptoms until they’re in their 40s, while others have symptoms starting in childhood; there can be a huge discrepancy,” says Dr. Massie.The PREMIER trial taking place at the CRU is looking for individuals living with mild to moderate CMT1A, who have a mutation in the PMP22 gene. This gene provides the instructions to make a protein called peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22).“The problem with this particular inherited neuropathy is that there’s a duplication of the DNA. These individuals have too much DNA which leads to too much RNA formation. And we think that this RNA is essentially toxic. So, the goal of the medications being tested is to reduce the amount of this toxic RNA,” explains Dr. Massie.The study sponsor, Pharnext used Pleotherapy, its proprietary technology platform to help systematically identify new drug combinations which could be repurposed to treat other diseases. The idea is that these combinations may be able to better target several disease pathways simultaneously while being formulated with more optimal doses of their components.Testing treatments off the shelf“The investigational treatment being tested, called PXT3003, is a combination of three commonly used drugs. Baclofen which is used to treat certain types of spasticity, including in Multiple Sclerosis; naltrexone, which is an opioid antagonist, administered after overdoses; and D-sorbitol, a form of sugar, which in diabetes is associated with neuropathy, interestingly enough,” says Dr. Massie.The trial will evaluate the effectiveness of the combined treatment using different scales, including the ONLS (overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale), a self-reported measure of upper and lower limb-related daily activities or the CMTNS-V2, a scale that combines multiple markers, including symptoms on patient reported outcome measures, in addition to findings from physical exam, EMG and nerve conduction studies.“This is the first clinical trial for inherited neuropathy at the CRU. The investigational treatment had very encouraging results in earlier phase II studies and showed improvement in some patients, and a slowing of progression in others. There is a huge need for treatments in this area, so this is exciting,” concludes Dr. Massie. For those with mild to moderate CMT1A who would like more information on participating in the PREMIER trial, contact info-cru.neuro@mcgill.ca or visit cru.mcgill.ca. Enrollment for the trial ends April 29, 2022. Tester des médicaments courants pour une maladie rareLe tout premier essai clinique au Neuro sur la maladie de Charcot-Marie-Tooth teste une combinaison de médicaments existants dans l’espoir d’en ralentir la progressionL’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro (Institut-Hôpital neurologique de Montréal) vise à rendre traitables toutes les maladies rares, en élargissant la gamme de traitements expérimentaux offerts aux individus qui n’ont souvent pas d’autres options pour gérer leur maladie. L’ajout de nouvelles maladies à la listed’essais courants est important pour atteindre cet objectif. C’est pourquoi l’URC est heureuse d’annoncer que le tout premier essai clinique au Neuro pour la maladie de Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) est en cours. Et surprenamment, l’essai étudiera comment une combinaison de trois médicaments couramment utilisés pourrait potentiellement ralentir la progression de cette maladie rare.Bien qu’elle soit plus répandue au Canada que la fibrose kystique ou la myasthénie grave, la CMT demeure moins connue. Selon la Fondation de neuropathie héréditaire du Canada, la CMT touche une personne sur 2 500.Il s’agit d’une neuropathie périphérique héréditaire, ce qui signifie qu’elle affecte les nerfs qui partent du cerveau et de la moelle épinière et s’étendent jusqu’aux pieds et aux mains. Ces nerfs ont du mal à envoyer des signaux vers et depuis le cerveau, ce qui entraîne un engourdissement, une faiblesse et une perte de motricité fine à mesure que les muscles se détériorent. Les personnes peuvent avoir besoin d’orthèses et d’appareils orthopédiques, de physiothérapie et d’ergothérapie ainsi que d’une intervention chirurgicale pour maintenir leur qualité de vie. Il n’existe actuellement aucun traitement ni remède contre la CMT.Un double problème« Il existe plusieurs types de Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). C’est un terme générique qui signifie que vous avez une neuropathie héréditaire qui affecte à la fois les fibres nerveuses motrices et sensorielles », explique le Dr Rami Massie, neurologue et l’un des chercheurs principaux des essais neuromusculaires à l’URC.Dr Rami MassieLa CMT est caractérisée en fonction de son effet sur les axones, les longs brins qui relient les cellules nerveuses. Dans le type le plus courant, CMT1, la maladie affecte la gaine de myéline protectrice qui entoure l’axone. Dans un deuxième type, CMT2, l’axone lui-même est affecté. Plus de 100 gènes ont été liés à la CMT, ce qui rend d’autant plus difficile la recherche d’un traitement efficace pour tous les patients atteints de CMT.“Bien qu’il n’y ait qu’un seul type de mutation impliqué dans CMT1A, ce qui est surprenant, c’est qu’il existe différents phénotypes – c’est-à-dire que la maladie peut se présenter très avec différent niveaux de sévérité et progressant à des rythmes différents. Certaines personnes ne remarqueront pas de symptômes avant d’avoir atteint la quarantaine, tandis que d’autres présentent des symptômes qui commencent dans l’enfance. il peut y avoir un énorme écart », explique le Dr Massie.L’essai PREMIER qui se déroule à l’URC est à la recherche des personnes vivant avec une CMT1A légère à modérée, qui ont une mutation du gène PMP22. Ce gène fournit les instructions pour fabriquer une protéine appelée protéine de myéline périphérique 22 (PMP22).« Le problème avec cette neuropathie héréditaire particulière est qu’il y a une duplication de l’ADN. Ces individus ont trop d’ADN, ce qui conduit à trop de formation d’ARN. Et nous pensons que cet ARN est essentiellement toxique. Ainsi, le but des médicaments testés est de réduire la quantité de cet ARN toxique », explique le Dr Massie.Le commanditaire de l’étude, Pharnext, a utilisé de la « Pleotherapy, » sa plateforme technologique exclusive, pour aider à identifier systématiquement de nouvelles combinaisons de médicaments qui pourraient être réutilisées pour traiter d’autres maladies. L’idée est que ces combinaisons pourraient mieux cibler simultanément plusieurs voies pathologiques tout en étant formulées avec des doses plus optimales de leurs composants.Tester des traitements existants« Le traitement expérimental testé, appelé PXT3003, est une combinaison de trois médicaments couramment utilisés. Le baclofène qui est utilisé pour traiter certains types de spasticité, y compris dans la sclérose en plaques ; la naltrexone, qui est un antagoniste des opioïdes, administrée après un surdose ; et le D-sorbitol, une forme de sucre qui, dans le cas du diabète, est associé à la neuropathie, ce qui est assez intéressant », explique le Dr Massie.L’essai évaluera l’efficacité de ce traitement combiné à l’aide de différentes échelles, dont l’ONLS (Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale), une mesure autodéclarée des activités quotidiennes liées aux membres supérieurs et inférieurs ou le CMTNS-V2, une échelle qui combine plusieurs marqueurs, y compris les symptômes sur les mesures des résultats rapportés par les patients, en plus des résultats d’examens physiques, d’électromyographie et des études de conduction nerveuse.« Il s’agit du premier essai clinique sur la neuropathie héréditaire à l’URC. Le traitement expérimental a eu des résultats très encourageants dans des études de phase II antérieures et a montré une amélioration chez certains patients et un ralentissement de la progression chez d’autres. Il y a un énorme besoin de traitements dans ce domaine, alors c’est excitant », conclut le Dr Massie. Pour les personnes atteintes de CMT1A légère à modérée qui souhaitent plus d’informations pour  participer à l’essai PREMIER, contactez info-cru.neuro@mcgill.ca ou visitez cru.mcgill.ca.

Promoting diversity in science,"For biologist Jessica Ford, pursuing a lifelong interest in herpetology – the study of amphibians and reptiles or, as Ford puts it, “things that live in the mud” – hasn’t always been easy.“From my elementary school experience through to undergrad, I’ve had people telling me, ‘Maybe you should reconsider,’ ‘Maybe you shouldn’t be doing this,’ ‘Maybe science isn’t for you.’“There’s very little that makes you feel so much like you can’t do something as someone explicitly telling you that you should reconsider.”But far from being deterred from following a path she was told was “weird for a girl,” Ford leaned in. She’s now a PhD student at the Redpath Museum, studying the effect of toad tadpoles on their aquatic ecosystems. She also serves as chair of STEMM diversity @ McGill, a group she helped found as an undergraduate student in 2017, which is devoted to promoting diversity in STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine), and providing resources to young women and girls considering careers in those traditionally male-dominated fields.Found her passion in childhoodLike many young children, Ford spent lots of time playing in mud and dirt. She quickly became fascinated with the animal life she encountered, becoming curious about those animals and their environments. That fascination grew into a passion for ecology and conservation, though as a child, she didn’t understand that her curiosity counted as science.“I never saw anyone represented in science who I could relate to, and didn’t realize scientists could be emotional or creative,” Ford recalls.Around that time, Ford began to hear the derisive comments about girls taking an interest in science,  which persisted in one form or another throughout her life.“I could tell that I was being treated differently,” she says. “In elementary school, no one was calling the boys weird for being interested in the ‘creepy crawlies.’ In high school, my male peers could ask for help without being told maybe they should reconsider their scientific pursuits, or that they wouldn’t make it in science if they were so emotional.”Eventually, she was able to overcome the negativity around her because of her passion, her stubbornness, and her support network of family, friends and mentors.“I had decided at a young age that studying and conserving reptiles and amphibians this was something I cared about, and I wasn’t going to let anything stand in my way,” Ford says. “I would motivate myself by proving people wrong and showing them that I really could do all these things they would say I couldn’t.”“You can have a place here, too”During her first semester as an undergraduate, she found out to her frustration that after all the hurdles and the pushback she overcame to make it into university, the dismissive comments persisted.“I worked up the courage to ask a professor a question after class, which I was pretty nervous about,” Ford says. “After the professor finished answering a classmate’s question, I asked him mine, and instead of an answer, I was treated to ‘Well, if you don’t understand that, you really shouldn’t be in science.’“At the moment I cried, as people do, but I decided to channel my frustration and try to make a difference, so that others wouldn’t have to overcome so much to get to where I was.”That incident was a catalyst which persuaded her to join forces with Charles Xu, a graduate student who was looking for ways to draw attention to issues of equality, diversity and inclusion in scientific fields, to create STEMM Diversity @ McGill. One of her first initiatives as part of the group was to write and illustrate a colouring and activity book for kids, to introduce young children to scientists from underrepresented backgrounds who have made significant contributions in STEMM fields – something Ford wishes she was exposed to when she was a child.“Something I find really empowering is finding someone who reminds me of me – someone I can identify with who is doing what I want to do,” she says. “[I wanted to offer kids] something that really spoke to them and explained there’s lots of people who do science. We all look different, and you can have a place here, too.”She also helped create a mentorship program for university students, and has given outreach talks to schools, libraries, and the Girl Guides of Canada.Ford also acknowledges that while she has overcome many obstacles during her journey, she recognizes the advantage she has of being a white woman.“I think it is important to remember just how much harder this is for BIPOC, queer, disabled, and any intersectionality of that, women. It is also important to remember those that were pushed out and excluded from pursuing their dreams in STEMM. We all have a place in this fight for a better STEMM community, and need to ensure that the future of STEMM is a just one.”","Thu, 02/10/2022 - 09:58"
McGill pushes forward to embed sustainability in the curriculum,"“No university can lead globally in the 21st century without putting sustainability at the centre of its operations, research, and teaching,” reads the McGill University Strategic Plan 2017-2022.And the McGill community agrees; in response to last year’s Sustainability Survey, 93 percent of students are interested in learning about sustainability themes and challenges, while 72 percent of faculty members are interested in incorporating sustainability in courses.Jessica Latus is McGill’s first Sustainability Officer with the mandate to bolster sustainability in teaching and learning activities.To address this cross-campus desire, the Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs) and Office of Sustainability have established a new full-time position with a focus on supporting and expanding sustainability-related teaching and learning opportunities at the University. This position was made possible thanks to support from the Principal’s Office.“Sustainability challenges are interdisciplinary in nature,” says Principal Suzanne Fortier. “We are proud to offer our students, irrespective of their area of focus, the opportunity to engage in sustainability and learn how they may play a role in creating a sustainable future.”The incoming Sustainability Officer, Jessica Latus, comes to McGill from the University of British Columbia (UBC)’s Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm where she managed their knowledge mobilization and translation efforts, expanding upon her experience in program management and development, strategic planning, and stakeholder engagement and facilitation. She holds a Master’s degree in urban ecology from the University of Helsinki and a Bachelor’s degree in biology from Arizona State University.“I am honored to take on this important role,” says Latus. “I feel passionately that universities are a key component in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To help meet this mission, universities need to ensure that sustainability is embedded across disciplines so that students can address the grand challenges of the 21st century.”Advancing McGill’s sustainability objectivesThe creation of the Sustainability Officer position aligns with the actions set out in the McGill University Climate & Sustainability Strategy 2020-2025. The Research & Education category objective is to identify strategies to increase learning and research opportunities in sustainability.Latus will play an integral role in making that happen; one of her key responsibilities includes supporting an interdisciplinary, multi-faculty committee mandated with strengthening sustainability content in the existing curriculum, identifying sustainability learning outcomes, creating resources for faculty, among other items.She will also be responsible in part for the Research & Education flagship action, which is to implement a sustainability online module available to all students, staff, and faculty members. The goal of the module is to provide foundational information about sustainability at McGill, while fostering a culture of sustainability on campus. The module will complement a new university-wide course on climate and sustainability that is currently under development.“We are looking forward to enhancing the integration of sustainability in all its forms into McGill’s teaching and learning activities,” says Dr. Laura Winer, director of Teaching and Learning Services (TLS). “In doing so, we hope to encourage greater interdisciplinary learning as we prepare our students for the future.”Latus will also bolster McGill’s leadership around the SDGs while supporting the development of an applied student research program aimed at advancing sustainability initiatives.“I believe that one of the best places to not only implement sustainable practices, but to also instil sustainable practices, is in our university system,” Latus says. “I firmly believe that young people are our future, and if we can empower them to be sustainability leaders, no matter their fields of study, then I believe we will have a chance to live in a world that is more in harmony both with nature and with each other.”Want to learn more about sustainability outside of the classroom?

A warm gesture for a cold winter,"Victoria Kalisky (left) and her father Lorne distributing winter jackets to the homeless in Cabot Square. (Courtesy Victoria Kalisky)The plight of Montreal’s homeless is heartbreaking at the best of times, but never more than during the city’s notoriously harsh winter cold snaps. The sight of people camping out and panhandling in the frigid temperatures can leave many of us with feelings of sorrow and helplessness. But for third-year McGill Political Science student Victoria Kalisky, it was an opportunity to take bold action to make the lives of those on the streets a lot warmer.On Jan. 22, Kalisky created a GoFundMe page to raise money to purchase warm clothes for homeless Montrealers. With help from family, friends and corporate partners, she has been able to distribute hundreds of parkas and other essential winter accessories to homeless shelters throughout the city. In its first two weeks, the page has raised more than $27,000, with a goal of raising $10,000 more.“I wanted to reduce their suffering”Kalisky got the idea for the page during a routine shopping trip in her neighborhood last month. Feeling her cheeks burn up in the intense cold, she tried to imagine what life was like for those who have to spend a lot more time outdoors than the time it took her to walk a few blocks.“I see the Milton Park urban Indigenous homeless people every day,” Kalisky said. “While doing my groceries in -30°, I felt disturbed by the idea that men and women would spend their entire night in that painful cold. I wanted to reduce their suffering.”At around the same time, she read a news story about a woman in her 60s who was found dead outside an entrance to the Berri-UQAM metro station on a night when temperatures dipped well below -20°C. It was the second time in 10 days that an unhoused Montrealer died from exposure to extreme conditions.This winter has been an especially harsh one for those without a place to call home. While an average January in Montreal would see overnight lows dip below -20°C eight times, this past month saw that happen 17 times. Making matters worse, space restrictions at shelters dictated by the COVID-19 pandemic are forcing more people than usual out into the streets at night.A team effortThe response to Kalisky’s GoFundMe effort was swift. Her father Lorne, the owner of a liquidation business, got some corporate friends to donate about $6,000 on the first day. As word of the fundraising effort spread in the media, donations continued to pour in steadily. He spoke with a local distributor about purchasing the coats, managing to get hundreds of them, normally valued at $300 apiece, for just $20 each. Meanwhile, Kalisky spoke with Nakuset, the executive director of the Native Women’s Shelter, about coordinating the delivery.“Our team spent the next few days delivering and distributing coats to homeless shelters,” Kalisky said. “During our first delivery at Cabot Square, we handed out 150 coats in thirty minutes. Undertaking an emergency initiative like this at a quick pace requires a combination of talking to local experts, fundraising, logistical support, and being present and empathetic.”Kalisky’s team has so far delivered 732 winter coats, along with 1,200 hats, 1,000 pairs of gloves, 232 children’s snowsuits, and 165 children’s coats to several local charities, including the Native Women’s Shelter, Resilience Montreal, the Open Door, and La Maison du Père. She says as long as the donations roll in and the situation remains urgent, she and her team will continue purchasing and handing out winter clothes.Kindness spreadsApart from easing the immediate needs of those in need, Kalisky hopes her efforts can inspire other people to take action. In addition to the cash donations, she has received a flood of emails from people offer their own winter clothes. A local fruit supplier has also donated about 2,000 oranges for shelters, and a medical equipment supplier has donated 2,000 face masks.Meanwhile, her efforts have also inspired people outside the city.“After hearing about this fundraiser, an individual in Toronto purchased 1,000 winter jackets for Toronto’s homeless,” Kalisky said. “A student in Quebec City has also expressed interest in organizing this initiative for their homeless community.”Governor-General Mary Simon also offered praise for the Kalisky’s efforts. During a recent interview with Montreal radio station CJAD 800, Simon thanked the Kaliskys for their compassion and their proactive approach to helping those in need. Meanwhile, Lorne Kalisky told the radio station that given the overwhelming need they’ve seen on the streets this winter, they are considering making this an annual campaign.","Tue, 02/08/2022 - 11:09"
Madame Iona spreads kindness during COVID,"Iona Amico is the recipient of the 2021 Jackie Robinson Undergraduate Award, given to students from the Black community who demonstrate both academic excellence and community involvementBASF Picture“You shouldn’t even have the right to education…you’re Black” were the hateful words said to Iona Amico by a fellow grade one student many years ago. Born in France and raised in Quebec, Iona Amico is the daughter of a Cameroonian mom and an Italian dad who grew up biracial in a predominantly Caucasian neighbourhood. Despite having faced incidents of bigotry and feeling like she was between two worlds, she did not let these experiences jade her.Quite the contrary; today Amico is a third-year Bachelor of Education Kindergarten and Elementary student who has gone above and beyond to spread joy and perform acts of kindness, particularly during the pandemic. As a result, she is the proud recipient of the 2021 Jackie Robinson Undergraduate Award. Bestowed by the Black Academic Scholarships Fund, this award is given to students from the Black community who demonstrate both academic excellence and community involvement.“COVID created an urge in me to help others and especially parents who were homeschooling their children,” said Amico, reflecting on the initial school closures of March 2020. Describing those initial weeks of stressful uncertainty, Amico felt particularly devastated by the disruption to the lives of young children. Motivated to find solutions to these new problems, Amico shared educational tools and resources on Facebook and Instragram. “I called these pages ‘Madame Iona,’ which is my teacher name in schools.”Parents who feared their children’s level of French would regress began contacting “Madame Iona” for help. Amico said she derived immense enjoyment in creating educational resources and in providing free online tutoring. “I decided to keep offering free tutoring services because this was my way of doing my part during those difficult times. For me, solidarity and generosity were really what was needed during the pandemic.”Teaching super powersWhen in-person teaching resumed, Amico began her 15-week internship in Brossard’s Harold Napper School. Despite the many challenges of being a student-teacher during COVID, Amico’s passion for education and her commitment to children fuelled her. “Working with a mask while respecting strict sanitary restrictions has been challenging, but one of our super powers as teachers is that we have this capacity to adapt quite well,” she said. “I have also been very surprised by how resilient children are.”While completing her internship, Amico championed a book drive to help renew the library of a local Montreal youth center and got the teachers at Harold Napper School involved. “Thanks to the students’ participation, we were also able to distribute Christmas cards to each of the 144 youth at the center.”‘A rare gem’Amico even surprised the entire school staff with a crepe bar. “I know that the teaching profession is not always appreciated, and I really wanted to show my colleagues that they are important and valued. Seeing my colleagues’ faces light up made my work so worth it!”Cooperating Teacher, Nathalie Leblanc, described Amico to be a dynamic and professional intern. “Iona has set the bar very high for my future stagières. She is a rare gem and the next generation of teachers that the school environment needs.”","Mon, 02/07/2022 - 15:31"
Engineering student joins 2041 ClimateForce Antarctic Expedition,"For many students, spring break means going south. For fourth-year Chemical and Environmental Engineering student Quang Anh Nguyen, this year’s spring break will mean going as far south as one can possibly go.From March 17 to 28, Nguyen will join a global team of young leaders on the 2041 ClimateForce Antarctic Expedition – a trip he hopes will help others understand the urgency of the current climate crisis.Nguyen will fly to the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia, Argentina, and journey through the Drake Passage to reach Antarctica. Once there, it’ll be time for ice trekking, volcanic sightings, and daily journeys to see penguins, glaciers, and sprawling mountains. In addition, he’ll listen to experts discuss climate science, renewable energy, and leadership development. He plans to document his journey on his Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts.From Vietnam to AntarcticaQuang Anh NguyenA native of Vietnam, Nguyen says he became interested in the issue of climate change in middle school, after hearing a program on a car radio about how thousands of species were lost every year due to changing climate patterns.“What was even more shocking was how the driver casually switched the radio channel after that,” he said. “It did not reconcile with me how many of us don’t even think twice about the huge amounts of animals that were going extinct because we disregard it as one of those ‘out there’ issues that is for someone else to solve.”By the time he reached high school, he understood that the climate crisis was the single greatest issue of his generation, and he began to educate himself more about environmental issues. From there, his interest moved toward how humans can deploy green innovations, such as clean energy and regenerative agriculture, to help minimize the damage to the Earth’s environment.Nguyen brought his passion for the issue to Canada, and to McGill, in 2018, where he began his Chemical Engineering undergraduate degree, with a minor in Environmental Engineering. He is now the co-president of the Research and Sustainability Network, an SSMU club aimed at bridging the gap between students and sustainability academia and careers. Last year, Nguyen joined with five others in creating the 200 Urban Garden, which aims to set up 200 new gardens in Montreal by turning underused pockets of land into lively greenspaces. The project was one of the ten finalists for the impact200 Sustainability Challenge, launched as part of McGill’s Bicentennial celebrations.‘Insanely cool’The organizers of the Antarctic expedition, the 2041 Foundation, recently approached Nguyen about making the long journey to Antarctica. Nguyen decided to apply for two reasons.“Firstly, going to Antarctica is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see some of the most pristine ecosystems in the world,” he says. “In other words, it’s insanely cool!“Beyond that, I aim to leverage the trip to better understand how I can create greater impact and encourage more people and organizations to adopt sustainable practices. I hope that by sharing a different side to sustainability and showing the grand beauty behind nature, I can inspire people who might not have been ardent climate advocates to start caring more about it.”Corporate sponsors, including Maple Leaf Foods and Ontario Power Generation, are helping Nguyen raise the bulk of the $22,000 he needs to fund the trip. He set up a GoFundMe page to help raise the rest.Once he returns, Nguyen has already lined up workshops to share his reflections. For the moment, he sees the trip as an exciting, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.“Coming from a small tropical city, Antarctica was the farthest thing from my imagination of possibilities,” he says. “I didn’t even think that ‘normal’ people could even go that far. So really, it was about believing in myself and that I can make the trip happen.”","Mon, 02/07/2022 - 13:21"

Black history chronicles the best and the worst of America: James Jones,"Dr. James Jones delivers the keynote address during the Opening Ceremony for Black History Month via Zoom In his keynote address at the Opening Ceremony for Black History Month on February 1, Dr. James Jones spoke eloquently about the foundational significance of slavery in the United States.“Without the enslavement of Africans, there would be no United States of America. That’s not hyperbole. That’s fact,” said Jones, the Trustees’ Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Psychological and Brain Sciences and Black American Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Diversity at the University of Delaware. “Slaves helped build colonial America and made the wealth of this nation possible.“Despite, or perhaps because, of their importance to the development of the United States, African slaves were dehumanized, stripped of all basic freedoms, and treated as commodities with no human rights,” said Jones.“You think about what life must have been like under those conditions. And you wonder how did they survive? How did they manage to create society, to create psychological health, to protect themselves physically, emotionally and psychologically in the world that was designed to strip them of all of that,” he said. “I think back on that and I reached this conclusion: The survival and evolution of Africans in America is a remarkable story in the history of the world.”“Black history chronicles the best and the worst of America,” Jones told the virtual audience.Black success in the shadow of slaveryAt several points during his address, Jones set the stories of his own success against the backdrop of slavery. In 1966, he became the first Black graduate student to be admitted to Yale’s Psychology Department. Four years later, he became the first Black faculty member of Harvard’s Psychology Department.While he called those years among the best of his academic experience, he was always aware that both institutions were built, or endowed, in large part through the slave trade.“Harvard benefitted from slavery in the same way that Yale did, and Brown did, and Georgetown did, and America did,” he said.Catalyst for changeJones told his audience that, as difficult as history can be to revisit, it is essential that we keep it close to better inform the future. “History happened. History matters. We are finding out that history can be a catalyst for change,” he said.“My academic journey was a Black history journey. I helped open spaces at Yale and Harvard for psychology to grow in relevance and awareness and for other Black students and scholars to enter,” Jones said. “Black history touches my life at every turn and is integral to being a citizen, Black or white, in the United States of America and, I’m sure, in other parts of the world including Canada.”Jones himself has helped initiate change. As the Executive Director for Public Interest and Director of the Minority Fellowship Program (MFP) at the American Psychological Association, he won 25 million dollars in training grant funds from the National Institute of Mental Health to support the professional development of about 1,500 students of colour who otherwise may not have been able to attend graduate training programs in Psychology and Neuroscience.Graduates from the MFP have gone on to careers as professors, researchers, mental health practitioners and university administrators, including a number of university presidents.“I think the value of what we’ve accomplished at the Minority Fellowship Program is the ability to [support] people with talent, capacity, character and commitment to spread throughout the world and find a place where they can be most effective and most valuable,” said Jones. “The MFP is more than the 1,500 people we have supported, it’s all of the impact they’ve had across the land.”Story of the world“Diversity is not easy. It’s hard work – as many of you know,” said Jones, addressing his audience. But he was adamant that people must continue to strive for diversity and to shoulder the heavy loads to achieve it.“Let me be clear, diversity, writ large, is a struggle for the soul of America, Canada and the world,” said Jones.And Jones is a man who knows something about diversity. His maternal grandfather was a slave born on a plantation in South Carolina; his paternal grandmother was park Black, part Cherokee; his paternal great-grandfather immigrated from Jamaica and his paternal great-grandmother was an immigrant from Switzerland.“My story is a story of the world,” he said.Full participation, nothing lessFor Jones, the end game of diversity is no less than what he calls “full participation.”“Full participation is a product of diversity. It isn’t diversity itself,” he said. “It is an affirmative value focused on creating institutions [and societies] that enable people, whatever their identity, background, or institutional position, to thrive, realize their capabilities, engage meaningfully in institutional life, and contribute to the flourishing of others.”He reminded the audience that, going back to the MFP model, “we’re not only trying to be supportive of individuals. We also want them to contribute to the flourishing of others. In the end, everyone helps everyone be better, live better, and be more fulfilled.”Compromise neededOne of the challenges with diversity is that it requires compromise.“Racism has a moral clarity. A racist is bad and non-racist is good. There is a moral clarity as to what is good and what is not,” says Jones. “Diversity presents moral ambiguity. What do we do when we have two goods that may conflict? How do we adjudicate that?“I think diversity has to figure out ways to adjudicate and navigate the dilemma of competing valid interests,” said Jones. “Diversity presents different expectations, needs, preferences and strategies… You can’t give everybody what they want so you have to make compromises. Diversity demands that.”Get more information about Black History Month at McGill","Thu, 02/03/2022 - 17:26"
Desautels unveils the Laidley Centre for Business Ethics,"David Laidley, BCom’67, is Chairman Emeritus of Deloitte LLP“We’ve all seen and read about situations where things go sideways because of ethical issues,” says David Laidley, BCom’67. “A company veers off the path a few small steps at a time, and then it gets further and further into the woods.”The Chairman Emeritus of Deloitte LLP retired back in 2007 after a successful 40-year career, but the topic of business ethics never left his mind. He currently sits on several boards, including EMCOR Group Inc. in the U.S. and Canadian Tire Real Estate Investment Trust.In the past year, the stark contrast between highly publicized scandals—most recently, the collapse of biotech giant Theranos—and the transparent, above-board operations of the companies he currently serves has left an impression on Laidley. When he realized that, unlike some other leading Canadian business schools, the Desautels Faculty of Management had no dedicated centre for business ethics, he pledged $5 million to close the gap.A broader conversationAnchored in the Desautels Faculty, the Centre will serve as a hub for McGill researchers across disciplines, from law and religion to economics and engineering, to work toward solutions for the most pressing ethical issues of our time.As envisioned, the Centre will seek to improve ethical decision-making for current and future leaders through a wide range of activities:Develop and support academic programming and activities that prepare current students to advance ethics in the workplace;Support value-based ethics research that influences and educates scholars, students, and business leaders from across disciplines; andEncourage discussion and learning among the wider McGill community through public symposia, guest lectures, and digital outreach.According to Yolande Chan, Dean of the Desautels Faculty of Management, any discussion of business ethics would ring hollow without taking equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) into account. “As a society, we’re slowly beginning to understand that leaders are only ethical when they work to advance the principles of EDI for employees and customers alike,” she says. “Thanks to the generosity of David Laidley, we have a unique opportunity to broaden the conversation surrounding business ethics.”Spirit of the lawIn Laidley’s experience, ethical crossroads are rarely marked with road signs and flashing lights. In all his years in a Big Four accounting firm, he can’t recall a single instance in which a client proposed a way forward that was illegal or glaringly unethical. “I was lucky in that my clients were committed to doing the right thing,” he says. But looking back, he acknowledges that the line between right and wrong was frequently blurry.“When I was working in tax, there were companies that were doing things that were certainly within the letter of the law, but they weren’t necessarily within the spirit of the law,” he says. Whether it was an issue concerning offshoring or another tax “loophole” a client wanted to exploit, Laidley occasionally confronted situations that made him uneasy because of how they subverted the intent of the law.These are the types of situations he hopes that students will unpack at the Centre. Ideally, Laidley says, the Centre will carve out space for fruitful discussion and debate surrounding ethical grey areas.In a highly multicultural, international environment like McGill, disagreement over business ethics is both expected and welcome. “With such a rich diversity of voices in our community, we are perfectly positioned to identify and discuss differences in ethical frameworks and foundations,” says Dean Chan.Laidley’s $5-million gift will endow the Centre, with an initial $500,000 allotted to hire its first few staff members. “I’m as eager as anyone to see how McGill’s talented researchers and students translate this vision into reality,” says Laidley. “I’m looking forward to seeing it grow and hopefully flourish into something useful.”Philanthropic gifts, like this gift from David Laidley, contribute to Made by McGill: the Campaign for Our Third Century, the University’s ambitious $2-billion fundraising campaign to support its bold aspirations for research, discovery and learning.","Thu, 02/03/2022 - 10:10"
Anne H. Charity Hudley on linguistic justice,"When we think about language, we tend to turn our attention to grammar, pronunciation and syntax. We focus on language as a tool that enables us to communicate with others. When seen through the lens of Linguistics however, language goes far beyond being just a means to express oneself. It points to additional considerations such as identity, power dynamics and inclusion.As part of Black History Month programming, on February 11, McGill’s Department of Linguistics is hosting a special virtual lecture titled “A Model for Linguistics Reparations” by Anne H. Charity Hudley, Professor of Education at the Stanford University Graduate School of Education.“As linguists, we recognize that all languages and dialects are equally rich, complex, and expressive, and an important part of community identity. However, we also know that linguistic discrimination is a real and often overlooked form of inequity,” says Jessica Coon, Professor and Canada Research Chair in Syntax and Indigenous Languages, who is a lead organizer of the event.Creating a just learning environmentThe lecture will feature findings and insights from the Talking College Project, a Black student and Black studies centred community-based research project that documents linguistic choices of Black students. The project is described as not only being about Black students but also for Black students in order to empower them.It also addresses the larger question of how to create a more just learning environment, something that is pertinent for anyone who participates in the educational milieu. “Dr. Anne H. Charity Hudley’s focus on race and language in educational settings makes this work especially important in an institutional context like our own,” says Coon.While most of us understand how languages differ from one another at a basic level, acknowledging language varieties can lead us to better understand how linguistic justice is connected to racial justice. We also become aware of how we personally use and perceive language through a much richer lens.“Language varieties allow us to see many more layers of language contact, language expression, differences across space and time, different by social factors that may include people’s own history, where they’ve lived, geographic history… It could be their social history by class, social and racial and ethnic identification. And language varieties allow us to bring in a lot about choice; how I choose to use my language,” explains Charity Hudley.Importance of inclusionIn many ways, language becomes directly tied to one’s sense of self and empowerment. Depending on which language varieties are deemed acceptable and embraced in specific settings, how we view ourselves and others is significantly impacted. Within educational settings, how we teach language raises issues of representation among student bodies as well as faculty.“The study of linguistics, the study of Indigenous languages, the study of African-Americans from across the Black diaspora have been fundamental in researching Linguistics in Canada but also in the U.S. But one thing that you really notice when you look at the departments in both countries is there are not a lot of Black people. What that does is change the questions [that are asked]. So, it’s really important for us to think about the ways that inclusion in studying language will change the ways that racial justice is studied and enacted upon using the areas that people who study language care about,” says Charity Hudley.“A Model for Linguistics Reparations”Virtual public lecture by Dr. Anne H. Charity Hudley (Stanford University)February 11, at 3:30 p.m.Register here (Pre-registration is required)(The event is co-sponsored by the McGill Department of Linguistics, the Faculty of Arts, the Arts Undergraduate Society, and the Society for Linguistics Undergraduates at McGill)Watch more of McGill’s Faculty of Arts pre-event video podcast (below) with Charity Hudley on linguistic justice.","Wed, 02/02/2022 - 23:07"
McCall MacBain Scholarships announce 50 finalists,"Nine McGill students and recent graduates are among the finalists for this year’s McCall MacBain Scholarships. Top (r to l): Aastha Goyal, Caitlyn McConnell, Nousin Hussain, Shirley Wang and Ghulam Jalani. Bottom (r to l): Janelle Brown-Walkus, Sabrina Bouferguene, Michelle Hahn-Baker and Tomo NewtonFifty students from across Canada have been named as finalists for this year’s McCall MacBain Scholarships, Canada’s first comprehensive leadership-based scholarship for master’s and professional studies.

Telephone Evolution Project rolls out,"Did you know, most departments at McGill are still using the phone system that was installed in 1986?  Yes, that’s over 35 years ago!After years of gathering requirements across the University, and a public Call for Tender, McGill’s IT Serives has selected an Internet-based (VOIP) phone service from Cisco. The new service introduces the Cisco Webex app, to be used as a “softphone,” allowing you the freedom and flexibility to make and receive phone calls from any computer, laptop, or mobile device… from the office, working at home, or in transit… anywhere you’re working.For those who receive frequent phone calls, work in a reception area, or prefer to have a desk phone, there will also be the option for a physical desk phone.https://www.mcgill.ca/tel-evolution/files/tel-evolution/mcgill-telephone-evolution-project-red.mp4Complement to existing toolsThe new telephone system and introduction of the Webex softphone is not meant to change the way McGill employees communicate and collaborate with each other. During the pandemic, while working from home, McGillians quickly adapted to using Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 apps to conduct online meetings, chat with teammates, and share and collaborate on files. IT Services will continue to promote these apps when dealing with internal colleagues. However, when you need to call someone outside McGill, such as when you’re recruiting new students or professors, reaching out to alumni, or contacting vendors, that’s where the Cisco telephone system can fill the gap. The Webex softphone allows you to seamlessly conduct work activities whether in the office or working remotely.“The new telephone system could not be coming at a better time,” says Marc Denoncourt, Chief Information Officer. “It will help McGill faculty and staff members adapt to today’s hybrid work environment, allowing their McGill phone to be accessible from virtually anywhere. This investment is very much aligned with our Digital Strategy, part of our 2020-2025 IT Strategic Plan, and shows how serious we are about improving the digital experience for faculty and staff.”Benefits and featuresUsing McGill’s new Internet-based (VOIP) phone service, you’ll be able to:Make and answer McGill phone calls from home or anywhere with an internet-connection.Keep your McGill phone number in most cases (extensions will be replaced by direct dial 10-digit numbers). Your McGill phone number will also follow you, like an email address, even if you move to another department.Never miss a call: forward calls, or use the “Single number reach” feature to designate your home or other phone numbers to ring during a specified schedule.Make free long distance calls throughout Canada and the United States. International overseas calling can also be requested at no additional cost.Easily put calls on hold, transfer to another party, and add multiple participantsAdd your own contacts and groups to manage them.Share lines to allow multiple users to answer departmental numbers.No monthly billing to the department/unit.Request advanced features (chargeable services), such as:Interactive voice menus, to triage calls for various departmental services (e.g. “Press 1 for sales, 2 for support”…)Hunt Groups, where incoming calls are routed first to one number, then another, in succession, until the call is answered.Project timeline and schedule of migrationsIn May 2021, IT Services launched a call for early adopters who were willing to use the softphone only. Over that summer and into the fall, IT Services migrated a few hundred faculty and staff members from several units across the University to the Webex softphone solution.To date they have migrated several departments/units, including University Advancement, Procurement and Financial Services, Family Medicine, New Model of Work, Provost and VP Academic, School of Social Work, Office of Sponsored Research, Student Wellness Hub, and IT Services.IT Services is now planning migrations in a building-by-building progression, beginning with those that have been upgraded to the new network infrastructure. As they identify each building to be upgraded, they will collaborate with the building director and telephone coordinators, who will act as liaisons to the project team, identifying the units and employees impacted, and collecting details about the phones, features, and preferences for type of phone experience (i.e., physical phone vs.  softphone-only with headset.)By the end of the project, IT Services will have replaced more than 10,000 phones in 180 buildings on McGill’s downtown and Macdonald campuses. This ambitious, large-scale project is expected to be completed around December 2023.Find out which buildings will be next on the schedule page of the Telephone Evolution Project website.Want to know more? Visit the Telephone Evolution Project website for FAQs, videos and learning resources.","Tue, 02/01/2022 - 17:05"
Ceremony marks fifth anniversary of Quebec City mosque shooting,"The victims of the Quebec City mosque shooting. Clockwise from top left: Azzeddine Soufiane, 57; Khaled Belkacemi, 60; Ibrahima Barry, 39; Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42; Abdelkrim Hassane, 41; and Boubaker Thabti, 44.On January 28, McGill hosted a virtual ceremony to pay tribute to the victims of the 2017 mosque shooting in the Centre culturel islamique de Québec, when a lone gunman killed six Muslim worshippers and injured five others.The ceremony brought together members of the University and Montreal community, including politicians, school administrators and representatives from the McGill Muslim Alumni Society, the Muslim Students Association, the McGill Thaqalayn Muslim Students’ Association, and the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill.“We gather today to honour the memory of those lost, as well as those injured, and to offer our support to their families and friends,” said Principal Suzanne Fortier in her opening remarks. “The memory of Khaled [Belkacemi], Azzeddine [Soufiane], Aboubaker [Thabti], Mamadou [Tanou Barry], Abdelkrim [Hassane] and Ibrahima [Barry] reminds us of the importance of fighting discrimination and intolerance.“This tragic anniversary also reminds us of the need to reaffirm in our own community at McGill, our ongoing commitment to the values of mutual respect and inclusion – and ensure that we all live up to these values,” continued the Principal. “Together, we raise our voices against intolerance, and we reaffirm loud and clear our ideals of respect, openness and inclusion.”Husbands and fathersDuring the ceremony, Muslim students read aloud the names of each man who was killed, along with a few words about their respective lives.“Abdelkrim Hassane died at 41 years old, leaving behind a widow and three young orphans. Abdelkrim was a computer analyst with the Quebec government. People described him as a man full of joy, love and laughter.”“Khaled Belkacemi died at 60, leaving behind a widow and three orphans. Professor Belkacemi was a soil scientist and food engineering professor at Université de Laval. His close friends describe him as a good father, always looking out for his children.”“Ibrahima Barry died at 39 years old, leaving behind a widow and four young orphans.” [The rest of this remembrance was cut short due to technical issues]“Mamadou Tanou Barry. He died at 42 years old, leaving behind a widow and two orphans. Mamadou was an accounting technician in Sainte-Foy. People close to him described him as generous, loyal, patient, welcoming and kind. He died while starting to raise funds for two wells in his community in Guinea.”“Aboubaker Thabti died at 44 years old, leaving behind a widow and two young orphans. He worked two jobs, as a pharmacy technician and as a nightshift worker at a poultry plant. He was said to have always helped newcomers getting their first apartments, cars and papers, always devoting his time to those in need.”“Azzeddine Soufiane died at 57 years old, leaving behind a widow and three orphans. Azzeddine was a geologist and was the owner of a butchery in Sainte-Foy. Azzeddine always extended his generosity to new immigrants and those who needed it in Quebec City. On January 29, 2017, Azzeddine died by charging at the shooter, sacrificing his life while protecting the others.”Strength in our diversityIn his remarks, Provost Christopher Manfredi spoke about the importance of coming together to combat the hatred and racism at the root of the Quebec City mosque shootings.“McGill has marked this day of commemoration each year since this terrible event. Some of you were also present for a ceremony in June 2018, during which a tree was planted on our lower downtown campus in memory of the victims,” said the Provost. “This tree is an Ironwood tree. Ironwood trees have the hardest and densest wood of any species in Canada. This is a symbol of our community’s unwavering commitment to openness, belonging, and inclusion.“With these gestures, we pay tribute to the victims of this unspeakable tragedy and demonstrate McGill’s deep commitment to an inclusive campus, where diversity is welcomed and celebrated,” said the Provost. “Our university brings together people from diverse backgrounds and of all origins, identities and beliefs. This diversity is a strength, and it feeds excellence at McGill.”“We can do better”The ceremony was closed by Sarah Abou-Bakr, this year’s recipient of the Centre culturel islamique de Québec (CCIQ) Memorial Award, for her efforts to promote awareness and understanding of the Muslim experience in Quebec and Canada.“Last November… my colleague and I went to the Quebec City mosque where the shooting took place to meet with the families, as we try to do every year, and to meet with the board,” said the Master’s Student at the Institute of Islamic Studies. “As we were passing by a room there was a class taking place and a man was teaching kids Quran. One of the board members told me that this man was shot in the stomach during the attack, but he made it.“I think that this is a reminder that regardless of hate, we are still here and we will be here spreading love and kindness no matter what – and we will get back on our feet every single time,” said Abou-Bakr.“I am grateful to be among you all today and I am extremely humbled and appreciative to be this year‘s recipient of McGill University’s Centre culturel islamique de Québec (CCIQ) Memorial Award,” she said. “But as much as I am grateful to be the recipient, I can’t help but think of this award as a reminder of the presence of Islamophobia in our society and in Canada. We still have a lot to work to do in order to eradicate this kind of hate. As we mourn, let us remember that we have lost other Muslims in Canada to Islamophobia throughout these past five years. It is terrible, and as a society we can do better.”Watch the ceremony below.","Tue, 02/01/2022 - 15:16"
Compost collection expands across McGill’s campuses,"McGill is expanding compost collection across its campuses, taking an important step towards the University’s target of becoming zero-waste by 2035.In December 2021, organic waste collection began in nine buildings on the downtown campus. Collection will begin in an additional 18 buildings across the downtown campus in early 2022, with new standardized bins coming to nine buildings on the Macdonald campuses during the same period.The expansion was made possible thanks to funding from the province’s recycling agency, RECYC-QUÉBEC, with additional support from McGill’s Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF).“By expanding compost collection on our campuses, McGill is taking an important step forward in its journey to zero-waste by 2035,” says Executive Director of Sustainability Francois Miller. “We look forward to working with the McGill community to continue improving our waste habits, both on campus and beyond, to create a more sustainable future for all.”Once operational, McGill is expected to recover at least an additional 100 tonnes of organic waste per year thanks to these improvements, equivalent to the weight of approximately 17 elephants.This will also increase the University’s diversion rate, meaning the percentage of waste diverted away from landfill or incineration. McGill’s diversion rate was 45.1 per cent in 2020, up 7.5 percentage points from the year before. McGill aims to achieve a rate of 90 per cent to meet the internationally recognized standard for zero-waste by 2035, with an intermediary target of 60 per cent by 2025.Supporting the next steps in the journey to zero-wasteTo support the expansion, McGill received $73,739.90 from RECYC-QUÉBEC within the framework of the Appel de propositions pour soutenir des projets visant la réduction, la récupération et le recyclage des matières organiques du secteur des industries, commerces et institutions. It is financed through the Fonds d’électrification et de changements climatiques. This allows McGill to build upon the groundwork laid in the the University’s Waste Reduction and Diversion Strategy 2018-2025.Through the implementation of the Strategy, the Buildings and Grounds department has installed hundreds of standardized multi-stream sorting stations across campus. Now, a selection of bins in the common areas of major academic buildings will be updated to include an organic waste stream.“Through projects, such as those currently underway at McGill University, across Québec, we will be diverting large quantities of organic materials from landfills and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the process. I invite the University community to actively participate in this project, which we are pleased to be able to support financially, and to contribute to its success,” says Sonia Gagné, CEO of RECYC-QUÉBEC.“The RECYC-QUÉBEC funding feeds into a multi-year effort to create a greener, more efficient campus waste management system, with the ultimate goal of supporting the zero-waste by 2035 target,” says George Lazaris, Director of Buildings and Grounds.“Offering organic waste collection across the campus has long been a key piece of this vision,” he says. “The funding from RECYC-QUÉBEC is the final piece of the puzzle to finally be able to offer this important service to the campus community. We are grateful for this support.”Big Wave supports big changes in waste managementMcGill’s Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF) is supporting further improvements to waste management on campus.The SPF is the largest fund of its kind in Canada, valued at $1 million per year. It has the mandate to build a culture of sustainability on McGill’s campuses through the seed funding of interdisciplinary projects. The SPF’s Big Wave funding stream supports large-scale, transformative projects that have a long-lasting impact on McGill’s campuses.The $400,000 project will see continued improvements to McGill’s waste infrastructure, financing the installation of additional multi-stream waste sorting stations in key areas outdoors on both the downtown and Macdonald campus. A key piece of the puzzle will also be engaging in a critical waste education campaign. The campaign aims to encourage students, staff, and faculty to play an active role in reducing waste and maximizing diversion by practicing proper sorting habits.“Ensuring that our community is well-informed about best practices in waste reduction and sorting is key to ensuring that the infrastructure is well-utilized.” says Lauren MacDonald, Sustainability Officer. “We hope that a peer-to-peer approach to waste education will create a ripple effect of behaviour change and foster a culture of zero-waste on campus.”Two new student interns, with the support of the Office of Sustainability, will create and disseminate a centralized suite of educational materials and resources while identifying opportunities to engage with the McGill community, such as at events, through tabling sessions on campus, and training peer volunteers.As of December 2021, McGillians can dispose of their organic waste in the Education, Gelber, Genome, James Admin, Leacock, McConnell Engineering, Redpath Library, Rutherford Physics, and Trottier buildings. A full list of locations can be found on the Waste Reduction at McGill webpage.Want to learn more about waste management at McGill? Register for the Office of Sustainability’s workshops, offered through Organizational Development and SKILLS21, or tune in for an Instagram takeover on Instagram.com/mcgillu on Wednesday, Feb. 2 to have all of your compost questions answered.","Tue, 02/01/2022 - 12:46"
Newly certified sustainable offices at McGill: Fall 2021,"The New Year often brings with it the desire to adopt new habits.For four teams at McGill, the Sustainable Workplace Certification program gave them a jumpstart, providing the space and resources to bolster their commitments to sustainability, both at work and at home. From mindful reflections about inclusivity to reducing reliance on single-use items, our newly certified teams have embraced sustainability in all its forms.Financial Services (Student Accounts) – Bronze Number of team members: 11Sample Bronze-level action: Eliminating waste by using reusable dishware and purchasing reusable coffee pods for machines.The second group within Financial Services to achieve Bronze-level certification, the Student Accounts team was motivated by their colleagues at 3465 Durocher, says Sustainable Workplace Ambassador Luisa Di Dio.While working at home, Di Dio says their team has seen how efficient they can be while using fewer office supplies, thus reducing paper and electricity use.“It provided more incentive to keep this up,” she says.Since beginning the certification process, Di Dio says, “the team’s response is welcoming, and the changes that were implemented are easy to follow.”“Our morale has been more positive, and engagement is increasing. We are learning to think of ways to better our lives by not using our cars and walking more at work, as well as at home.”Desautels Faculty of Management Masters Office – BronzeNumber of team members: 19+Sustainability goal: Work toward achieving gold-level certification in 2022The Desautels Faculty of Management Masters Office is walking the walk.“One of the transversal themes in [our faculty’s] strategic plan is to champion sustainability,” says Wesley McCoy, Sustainable Workplace Ambassador for the Desautels Faculty of Management Masters Office. “Our team was motivated to seek certification to raise awareness of this program within the faculty and to leverage our certification to challenge other units in our faculty to work toward certification.”McCoy explains that the certification process has “fostered an awareness of the small measures that can be taken that have a large impact on our sustainability.”The Office, he continues, has responded positively to the certification, and worked together collaboratively through the processThe team now hopes to continue reducing their ecological footprint while adopting more sustainable behaviour as they work towards achieving a silver-level certification, before hopefully moving onto gold and platinum.Office of Investments (OOI) – Gold Number of team members: 12Sample Gold-level action: Attend two workshops hosted by the Equity Team.Seeking certification just made sense for the Office of Investments.“Sustainability is a priority for the University. Moreover, the OOI incorporates environmental, social and governance considerations in investment processes,” explains Sustainable Workplace Ambassador Victoria Mei-Zummo. “As such, implementing further sustainability practices in our daily work is a natural continuation of McGill’s collective efforts and the work we already do in responsible investment.”As a result of seeking certification and moving up the ranks—the team had achieved silver-level certification last February—Mei-Zummo says they have an increased awareness of the breadth of topics included in sustainability, “from individual carbon footprints to gender diversity,” for example.She explains that members of the OOI try to embed sustainability into their daily lives, for example by hosting a sustainability-themed gift exchange or encouraging reflections around inclusivity in day-to-day conversations. Through the certification process, the team continues to share tips as they work on implementing best practices.“Overall, the team is proud to contribute further to McGill’s sustainability efforts,” says Mei-Zummo.IT Communications – Platinum Number of team members: 29Sample Platinum-level action: Include sustainability in each member’s Performance Dialogue, responding to IT’s unit objective for 2021.As the first team to reach platinum-level Sustainable Workplace Certification, the IT Communications team made significant strides in embedding sustainability into their lives, at McGill and beyond, over the past year. What keeps them motivated?“Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it’s not.” – Dr. SeussThe team says they repeat the Dr. Seuss quote during certification meetings and in the onboarding process as a reminder as to why such dedicated efforts are valuable.Sustainable Workplace Ambassadors Uma Viswanathan and Amanda Morris wrote that they’ve observed a variety of responses to the certification process from their team members. Overall, they say they “have been pleasantly surprised by the acceptance of our sustainable changes, such as replacing single-use milk and cream pods with cartons, that impacted our entire floor, beyond our participating team.”As they move forward beyond the certification program, Viswanathan and Morris say the IT Communications team is now looking at “other opportunities to promote sustainability beyond the four levels, through special projects and initiatives, and partnering with other groups on campus.”What lesson do they have to share with other offices on campus seeking certification? “We can always do more in improving our habits: There is no end of sustainability–we can always do better.”The Sustainable Workplace Certification program includes environmentally, economically, and socially aware action items to inspire sustainable changes at work and at home.

Federal government invests in 15 projects that support the implementation of Canada’s national dementia strategy,"A new initiative by McGill University’s Dementia Education Program is among the 15 projects that will receive funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada to raise awareness of dementia and promote dementia-inclusive communities, announced the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos today.The Dementia Community Investment (DCI) will invest $758,430 to support the development of Ten Online Modules over Ten Weeks for Adult Learners (TOTAL) eLearning for Family/Friend Care Partners of People Living with Dementia. This project will adapt and enhance the existing bilingual Dementia Education Program workshop content to the current COVID-19 context by using a virtual learning platform to educate and support family/friend care partners of people living with dementia.The goal of TOTAL eLearning is to increase knowledge about dementia and decrease social isolation experienced by informal care partners. By creating a flexible and accessible virtual learning platform, this project will also enable rural populations to access resources and supports that have primarily been available only in urban settings.“Family and friend care partners of people living with dementia are often isolated, both physically and socially, and unfortunately, the pandemic has exacerbated these issues. We want to connect with this vulnerable population and provide a community education experience that is culturally relevant and engaging. The new TOTAL eLearning platform will allow us to deliver these needed resources in an online format to support the people who need it the most,” says the principal investigator for this initiative, Tamara Carver, PhD, Assistant Professor at the Institute of Health Sciences Education and Director of the Office of Education Technology and E-learning Collaboration for Health (Ed-TECH) at the McGill Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.TOTAL eLearning will reach diverse communities in Montreal as well as remote communities in rural Quebec. The future goal is to expand the reach nationally through partnerships with the Alzheimer Society of Canada, the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration and Aging and Dementia Advocacy Canada.“This support from the Public Health Agency of Canada will allow us to further leverage the outstanding expertise within the Dementia Education Program and work with community partners to enhance the wellbeing of people living with dementia and their care partners,” says Vice-Principal (Health Affairs) and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at McGill University, David Eidelman, MDCM.  “By working together and finding innovative ways to connect with and support our communities, we will build healthier, more resilient societies.”Read the government press release","Mon, 01/31/2022 - 15:34"

Black History Month 2022,"The theme of this year’s Black History Month at McGill is “community” – an apt focus for an event that, now in its sixth year, brings people together to celebrate Black culture and the important achievements of Black people at McGill, in Montreal and around the world.Of course, creating that sense of community is a huge challenge during the COVID pandemic, when social distancing and Zoom meetings are the norm. Like so many of the activities and events we hold dear, BHM will be all virtual this year.“It is definitely challenging to replicate Black History Month during the pandemic given Black History Month is a time where the Black community comes together to learn, celebrate, laugh, eat and dance and so much more,” says Shondra Mings, Equity Education Advisor, Anti-Oppression and Anti-Racism Education, and one of the organizers of BHM. “While I think that many are excited to reconnect in person, we are happy to be able to have our events virtually this year as a way to bring everyone together.”“The Office of the Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic), in partnership with the Faculty of Science, are holding four main events, but there will be a variety of events hosted by student clubs and departments and faculties,” says Karen Diop Program Manager, Anti-Black Racism Action Plan, and BHM co-organizer. “We think the variety of events are certainly keeping the spirit of BHM alive, even if virtual.”The advantages of being onlineThis year’s program is diverse, bringing together scholars, researchers, artists, musicians, entrepreneurs and members of the community – an extended community, at that.“Being virtual has an advantage because our events are able to reach audiences we may not have before on campus, within the city and even across Canada,” says Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo, Black Student Affairs Liaison, and BHM co-organizer. “Typically, there tends to be a lot of Black History Month events so it is hard to attend all. This way, people can tune in from the comfort of their own homes or from their places of work. We even had someone email us who would be attending from Vancouver, which is pretty exciting.”February 1: Opening Ceremony and Keynote AddressThe Opening Ceremony will feature Dr. James Jones, the Trustees’ Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Psychological and Brain Sciences and Black American Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Diversity at the University of Delaware. Dr. Jones’ will deliver the keynote address titled Diversity within Psychology. In advance of the event, Dr. Jones has written an op-ed for the Reporter, which can be read here.The keynote speech will be followed by a special steel pan drum performance by Upköng Etang.February 9: Black Perspectives: Artists Navigating Spaces This panel discussion will feature Modibo Keita (who performs under the name Simb0), a multi-disciplinary artist and music entrepreneur; Koudjo, a music producer and entrepreneur; Montreal singer-songwriter, Sarah MK; and Camille Thurman, an Assistant Professor, Jazz, at the Schulich School of Music.Panelists will share their knowledge and lived experiences navigating cultural and institutional spaces throughout the city of Montreal.February 17: Decolonizing Approaches to ResearchThis panel will explore approaches to research in the Caribbean as well as McGill’s historical research relationship with Barbados through the Bellairs institute.Moderated by Jean Saint-Vil is Special Advisor to the Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation, the panel will include Dr. Terri Givens, the Provost’s Academic Lead and Advisor on McGill’s Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism; Dr. Saleem Razak, a professor of pediatrics and health sciences education; and Jamila Dei-Sharpe, a Sociologist completing her PhD of Social and Cultural Analysis at Concordia University.Asia Blackman (currently pursuing a Master’s of Science in Epidemiology) and Khaelan King (currently pursuing a BA in political science with a minor in sociology) will also participate.February 24: Soul Food BoxLocal Caribbean and African restaurants will prepare a delicious boxed lunch for people who register in advance. Make sure you reserve your meal by registering here for your Soul Food Box by Thursday, February 17.“Planning Black History Month events at McGill takes significant coordination with faculties, community partners, staff, student associations and so many more groups,” say the co-organizers. “BHM is about bringing communities together, so in the planning it was important for us to ensure that we have events and guests that speak to different audiences as well as cover different topics.“With the ever-changing landscape of the pandemic we had to have contingency plans in case our events could not take place in person making the planning a bit more complex. Although it does take a lot of coordination, it is definitely a labour of love and we are beyond grateful for all those who played a part in this coming together.”Find out more about Black History Month 2022.

Dr. James Jones: Surviving while Black,"The Opening Ceremony of McGill’s Black History Month will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 1, from 5 – 7 p.m. on Zoom. The keynote speaker is Dr. James Jones, the Trustees’ Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Psychological and Brain Sciences and Black American Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Diversity at the University of Delaware. As Director of the Minority Fellowship Program, Dr. Jones was awarded 25 million dollars in training grant funds from the National Institute of Mental Health to support the professional development of some 1,500 students of colour who otherwise may not have been able to attend graduate training programs in Psychology and also Neuroscience.Dr. Jones is a social psychologist whose research has focused on racism, temporal orientation and its influence on personality and the personality orientations of Black Americans that evolved from African origins and which represent adaptations to the challenges of oppression, marginalization and discrimination in the United States.In advance of his keynote address, Diversity Within Psychology, Dr. Jones has written the following op-ed entitled Surviving While Black.We hope you will join us for Dr. Jones’ keynote. Please register here.Surviving While BlackWithout the enslavement of Africans, there would be no United States of America! Slaves built colonial America and made the wealth of the Nation possible. DESPITE, or perhaps because of their importance to the development of the United States, African slaves were dehumanized, stripped of all basic freedoms, and treated as commodities with no human rights. Black history chronicles the best and worst of America.James Jones is an internationally recognized scholar in the areas of prejudice, racism and diversity.Black History Month (BHM) was conceived in 1926 by the Black Historian Carter G. Woodson as Black History Week – the second week of February which coincided with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln (the 12th) and Frederick Douglass (the 14th). The BHM view of Black history is an antidote to an historical narrative that made Black people out to be what White people wanted or needed them to be.  BHM has, for nearly a century, provided a Black counter-narrative of strength, courage, brilliance, resilience and opportunity, talents and accomplishments.My focus on this narrative is grounded in my training as a social psychologist and my decades of living as a Black man in America. How did Black people get from their arrival in America in 1619, to their significant and consequential presence in 2022?  Two principal obstacles had to be overcome. First, massive dehumanization was a racist design to strip Africans of their human worth, and provide a narrative that they were subhuman, infantile, and ignorant souls who were only suited for the oppressive conditions to which they were subjected.The second was the White supremacy narrative and edifice of domination and control that deprived Africans – and Blacks in future generations – fundamental human rights to liberty, justice and the pursuit of happiness. I argue that Africans drew upon their African cultural roots and adapted them to combat these oppressive and dehumanizing circumstances and forged a psychological and spiritual resilience that has supported the evolution of the race over the past four centuries.I propose two ways in which Black resilience has been achieved.The first is an integrative set of five African cultural characteristics with their associated psychological attributes that contribute to distinctive and strategic approaches to survival. They are Time – focusing on the immediate circumstance and attending to every nuance that it holds for both threatening possibilities and meaningful moments; Rhythm – a synergy and flow between people and their environment, creating a flow that maximizes creativity and efficiency; Improvisation – the ability to conceive different means of reaching one’s goals when obstacles, seen and unseen, block them.  It also creates a self-defining style that expresses creativity and unique personal value; Orality – ability to communicate in personal and public ways in order to share knowledge, express emotions, and erect boundaries of meaning that keep others out and lets kindred spirits in; Spirituality – acknowledges the interconnectedness of all things, and puts ones well being in the hands of powerful forces for good or bad.These five cultural characteristics and their psychological attributes create TRIOS.  They comprise attitudes, abilities, beliefs and a behavioral repertoire that is strategically suited to for vigilance in a threatening and uncertain world, and a powerful form of self-expression and personal and collective fulfillment.  Our research shows that highly TRIOSic people are more psychologically healthy, more resilient in the face of adversity, and more flexible in how they approach challenging racial situations.The second is the vigilance and self-awareness that arises from living in a racialized world that brings a negative focus on you because you are Black. I call this the Universal Context of Racism (UCR).  The likelihood and nature of sorting out the relevance and impact of race in any situation has three basic features: Salience – my race is socially significant and historically stigmatized. It is a salient feature of my world, and while it may not always be the cause of how I am treated, it aways could be.  Transcendent – my race is a source of pride, and despite obstacles and challenges, I am secure in who I am, and work all the harder to reach my goals; Racelessness – I do not see race as an obstacle, or racial discrimination as a problem because I value myself as a person beyond my race.Our research shows that the more salient one’s race is, they experience more racial hassles, more anxiety, and the lower self-esteem. Conversely, when black students adopted a transcendent view of race, they reported fewer racial hassles, had higher self-esteem and greater psychological health. A racelessness orientation lead students to reject race as a defining characteristic and to see it as irrelevant to their life experiences.TRIOS and UCR consciousness describe ways in which Black people have confronted and conquered racism and oppression. They motivate activism, energize creative expression, and fuel hard work and determination.  The crucible of oppression and racial discrimination has forged a psychological strength, creativity and passion that elevates the race and makes the world a better place.","Thu, 01/27/2022 - 15:43"
" EDI at Desautels Faculty of Management: In conversation with Lisa Cohen, Director of EDI","“I believe that EDI, managing EDI, respecting diversity, providing equity and making sure that everyone feels included – is an imperative, in organizations and in individual lives,” says Lisa Cohen.Owen Egan / Joni Dufour In August of 2020, McGill’s Desautels Faculty of Management made major strides towards creating a culture of inclusivity by appointing Professor Lisa Cohen as its first-ever Director of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.“My mission is to understand and work to address any systemic racism and inequalities that exist within Desautels and society at large and to strengthen our culture so that the values of equity, diversity and inclusion become part of the fabric of our Faculty,” said Cohen at the time of her appointment. “I am here first to listen and earn the trust of students, faculty and staff.”Not only is this something that’s important to the Faculty, as evidenced by their efforts to create the role and build a foundation upon which growth could occur, but this is something that’s highly important to Cohen personally.“My work on EDI in the Faculty ties into my broader beliefs about why EDI is so important in the world,” she explained. “I believe that EDI, managing EDI, respecting diversity, providing equity and making sure that everyone feels included – is an imperative, in organizations and in individual lives. In addition to there being moral arguments about supporting EDI as the right thing to do, you can think about possible ways that that supporting EDI can help you make a better organization.”Equity, diversity and inclusion is a strategic priority at the university level, so it was only natural for the Faculty to follow suit in appointing a representative to see it through and at the time. Former Desautels Dean Isabelle Bajeux-Besnainou called the move “an investment in [Desautels’] communities and creating a culture and environment that brings diverse perspectives to the forefront of our organization.”No easy taskCohen entered this role with a lot to tackle. First on her to-do list, though, was to create structures that would allow her to accomplish her work.“There was no formal structure,” Cohen explained. “There were a lot of things happening that related to EDI, but nothing that could pull it all together.”Once her position was created, she worked with the communications team to pull together a webpage to keep Desautels’ community members informed of EDI initiatives and progress. She and her team then founded the EDI First Responders program which is still running today, and which provides an outlet for students, faculty and staff to go to if they experience or are aware of harassment, discrimination or other equity issues based on membership within an under-represented group at Desautels.Collecting data“The biggest thing, our big focus, in that initial phase was in collecting data so that we would be solving the problems we actually have, rather than the problems we thought we had,” said Cohen. “We gathered a lot of data across the populations we serve, our students, our alumni, our staff, and our faculty, to learn about our representation, about how our processes work for each of these groups, and about the experiences of various people within those groups.”The Faculty’s EDI efforts have come a long way in the last year and a half, and that’s come with its fair share of ups, downs and surprises.“Some of them were very good surprises,” Cohen said. “For instance, I discovered that many of our faculty members, staff and students, had a huge appetite to have more done around equity, diversity and inclusion.”“On the other side of it, I’m always surprised that things take as long as they take, which is funny because I teach organizational behaviour. That is one of the things that we teach people, change is hard and change takes time. But somehow, I believed that I could make things happen immediately. And I know people really wanted things to happen immediately, but it took longer. I think we’re better for it, but it took longer.”A balancing actPerhaps most challenging for Cohen in her quest to improve the culture and values at Desautels has been balancing the different stakeholders at the various levels of the Faculty. It’s not only the students and faculty members who have skin in this game, but the administrative staff, alumni and other affiliates of the faculty as well.“At one point, we tried to map our stakeholders and we realized it was an impossible effort, because we had four big groups, our students, our staff, or faculty, our alums,” she explained. “But each one of those could be broken up into 10 more groups and, and so to track all of these complexities and providing all of the different groups with what they need and what they want is a real challenge. Often, everybody thinks their problem is ‘the problem’ that should be solved. And what I see in this role is that there are dozens of ‘the problems.’”One major issue they encountered with this was with the EDI working group established early on in Cohen’s tenure as Director or EDI.“It worked well for our first steps but then it became so broad and big that the group became unwieldy,” Cohen said.  “We are working on a new structure going forward.”Common threadIn addition to finding balance with stakeholder interests, Cohen also balances a full schedule. Director of EDI on a part-time basis, if you will, Cohen is also still teaching organizational behaviour at the Faculty and continuing her research, some of which touches on EDI concerns and performing other administrative work.“I love it when that research and teaching feeds back to the work I am doing around EDI,” Cohen said. “I did a presentation at our big academic conference over the summer about a woman named Rosabeth Moss Kanter, who was a leader in doing research around the structural aspects of organizations and how that affects women’s experience. That link made me feel really like my worlds were coming together.“In addition, I am currently teaching negotiations and so much of that relates back to EDI. We approach negotiations as a way to manage conflict and a lot of the issues around EDI come down to kinds of conflicts. It’s hard to do everything, but it’s amazing when these worlds actually overlap and speak to each other.”Laying the groundwork for the years to comeIn order to forge a clear path forward and help fortify the different structures put into place over the last year and a half, Cohen and her team are launching an EDI strategic plan, providing an overview of the current challenges and detailing strategic goals and initiatives for the coming years.“We are in the process right now of doing consultations on our strategic process with various groups of stakeholders” Cohen said. “We need to shift the culture, infuse the culture and the values with EDI considerations, we need to assure that our structures and processes respect and advance EDI.“And also, because we’re within a business school, it is critical that that we build the base of knowledge that we use to understand things around EDI, and that we do that through research, but we also do that by providing thought leadership and publishing things on places like Delve and by incorporating it in the classroom.”In order to meet these goals, the strategic plan outlines specific initiatives that touch on each. Some examples include the creation of new guidelines for recruitment processes both at the student level and for staff and faculty, with more frequent opportunities to review these structures and processes for equity considerations, and training opportunities that will help to increase knowledge and awareness around EDI at the staff and faculty level.Transparency is keyPerhaps most important to the strategy and its priorities, though, is the need and the desire for increased transparency.“If we are going to achieve what we want to it’s critical that we are transparent and accountable, which means we need to report what we’re doing,” Cohen stressed. “It also means that we need to reevaluate what we are doing periodically and make course adjustments as needed. We’re not going to get everything right the first time. But if we pay attention, we can fix things and make them better.”While it’s difficult to have measurable deliverables when it comes to EDI, ultimately Cohen hopes that this strategy will usher in major changes to the culture at Desautels.“I hope that this ends up being evident through things like doing a better job at attracting and retaining people from underrepresented groups,” Cohen said. “Where people feel much more comfortable and like they can really bring themselves forward in the classroom or the meeting or wherever it is, and where I can see marked changes in some of the processes and structures that exist in the organization,” she added.","Thu, 01/27/2022 - 12:26"
Progress report: McGill’s Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism ,"In September 2020, Principal Suzanne Fortier shared McGill’s Action Plan to Address Anti-Black Racism (AP-ABR) with the McGill community. The sweeping five-year plan outlines the University’s commitment to implementing concrete measures aimed at enhancing equity and inclusiveness for Black students, faculty, and staff.  Using McGill’s Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) Strategic Plan as a framework, the Action Plan focuses on addressing anti-Black racism in five critical areas: student experience; research and knowledge; outreach; workforce; and physical space – as well as a commitment to investigating the University’s historic connections to the transatlantic slave trade, setting targets for Black students, faculty, and staff: and institutionalizing anti-racism efforts and resources.  Last fall, the Office of the Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic) published the first annual report on the AP-ABR.  We check in with Angela Campbell, Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies), and Terri Givens, Professor of Political Science and the Provost’s Academic Lead and Advisor on the AP-ABR, about the progress that has been made in the first year, and what’s ahead.  What specific strides has the University taken in the first year of the AP-ABR?   Angela Campbell: There’s been a multi-pronged effort. There are three main strands: support, education, and response.   For support, we committed to the appointment of at least one Wellness Advisor or Counsellor in Student Services with expertise in connection with the psychological impacts of racism, including systemic and anti-Black racism. The Local Wellness Advisor for BIPOC students was appointed in January 2021 to that role, and since then, she has provided services thus far to over 120 students, including to some who reported experiences of discrimination, anti-Blackness, and exclusion in their programs or departments.  Angela Campbell, Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies)Antoine-Samuel Maufette Alavo, our Black Student Affairs Liaison, joined the Office of the Provost in January 2021, and has worked closely with the Faculties to establish a range of internship opportunities; he’s ended up placing many students with different organizations, including in the disciplines of neuroscience, biology, and the humanities.  Antoine has also partnered with CaPS, the Career and Placement Services office, to support Black students who are going through CaPS to look for different employment opportunities.  Also, Professor Terri Givens, as the Provost’s Academic Lead and Advisor on the Action Plan, is working with McGill’s Varsity Athletics staff to lead workshops with a view to building a stronger, more inclusive climate for all our student athletes, notably those who might experience racism or other forms of social oppression.  For education, there are two main things. There is an online module that’s being built right to address systemic racism and how to confront it. The module will be modeled on the It Takes All of Us sexual violence learning program. It will aim to broaden and deepen our collective understanding of what systemic racism is, and how it can impact the experiences of racialized members of our communities. The new module will be completed in the coming year.  The second major education element consists of ongoing in-person facilitated training sessions by Teaching and Learning Services (TLS) and the Equity Team. We are aiming to reach the leadership through the deans who are very onboard, and then through the chairs and directors.   In terms of response, we want to ensure that we have policies in place so that when instances of discrimination occur, they are duly investigated and addressed. We just revised our Policy on Discrimination and Harassment last year and put in place a very robust mechanism and set of resources with respect to investigating those claims.  Can you talk more about the ABR Working Group? Who sits on it, and what is its mandate?  Terri Givens: The working group meets every three weeks, and since most of the members of the working group only started in the last six months or so, we’re in the process of developing a project management system, so we can be checking on a regular basis, where we’re at with different components of the plan.  We also eventually want to develop an online dashboard that will be available to the public, but we’re still in the process of developing that in a way that makes sense because we are a big group.  I expect by spring we will have a clear picture of how we’re going to start tracking the different components of the Plan in a public way.   How have students been engaged in the first year of the AP-ABR?  Terri Givens,  Professor of Political Science and the Provost’s Academic Lead and Advisor on the AP-ABRTerri Givens: We have a lot of work being done on at the student level right now. Antoine-Samuel Maufette Alavo, the Black Student Affairs Liaison, is our main point person on that front, and he’s working very closely with the different student groups to develop programming. For example, he’s working with them on Black History Month, and the work we’re doing with Athletics is very much focused on not just the coaching staff, but also the students. So, there are a lot of different initiatives that are going on, including work that’s being done in Student Services.    Angela Campbell: During the past year, members of the Provost’s team have met regularly with the leadership of the MASS (McGill African Students Society) and BSN (Black Students Network) to make sure that we get their feedback and we can share developments.   The Student Services team also led and facilitated spaces last year called Being Black at McGill, and that has really been helpful for developing a specific plan within Student Services to serve the needs of Black students. So again, we’re really focused on not just having a plan, but serious commitment to implementation.   Can you talk about what’s being done to address microaggressions?  Angela Campbell: We have spent a lot of time listening and learning, particularly to students who are on the receiving end of microaggressions. In terms of holding people accountable, it’s about getting people to the point where they understand what a microaggression is, why it is so difficult for people to go through these experiences on our campuses, and how it can cause students and members of faculty and staff to feel like they don’t belong; it can impact their wellness and their capacity for success. A person who’s not racialized will often not understand why they’re so harmful or painful. Our first effort right now is on getting people to the point of understanding, so that the behaviour can change.  In terms of what we do when microaggressions occur, our interventions focus on awareness raising and on support. We focus on helping people understand the impacts of microaggressions and how not to repeat them. We also focus on the person who has been hurt, to help them feel supported and to remind them that they belong here, they belong at McGill.  Do you have any evidence of the impact or influence of a module like It Takes All of Us on students’ perspectives, and how will we know that it will actually influence critical thinking and encourage discourse about ABR?  Angela Campbell: I have had lots of questions put to me about It Takes All of Us, specifically from campuses that are interested in doing something similar. I would say, I am a skeptic in regard to learning modules by themselves. Such modules cannot do the work of achieving equity. I want to be perfectly transparent about that. So, the modules’ value is in signaling to the community that this issue matters.  The content is helpful to a point, but you don’t learn to be anti-racist in 40 minutes. This is a lifelong undertaking that you we must be willing to engage through iterative practice that is not linear. It’s about living and learning with humility and perseverance. That’s our understanding. That’s our commitment.   Terri Givens: The reason I developed my radical empathy approach is because this is such difficult deep work, and it takes time. And I would say the other thing is, we’re trying to change this culture in terms of developing a culture that is welcoming to Black students, faculty and staff so, you have to take a broad approach to make sure that you’re approaching it from different levels and from different perspectives.   The statue of James McGill was removed over the summer. The EDI office has stated that a final decision on what to do with it would be made before the end of the Bicentennial year in March. Is there an update?   Angela Campbell: I don’t have any updates on that, where the ultimate landing place of the sculpture of James McGill will be.  No matter what, I do think it’s important that a stronger understanding of the institution’s history and connections to the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, and the funding from which post-secondary institutions, all institutions, founded during the 19th century were created. At the time that McGill was established, much of the capital was intimately tied to a colonial economy. And that is a story that needs to be told and understood, not only for the sake of understanding that history, but also to achieve an understanding of today’s realities and social inequities, and how to address these.   Terri Givens: The working group is going to be working on the History project this year. It is already up and running, to a certain extent, but we’re also looking more broadly at connecting with not only Black McGill, but Black Montreal and Black Quebec.   The AR-ABR has a goal of growing McGill’s Black faculty to 85 Black tenure-track or tenured professors, or 5 per cent, by 2032, with an interim goal of 40 by 2025. What progress has been made?  Angela Campbell: As of September 2020, there were 14 tenure-track and tenured professors at the University who self-identified as Black in McGill’s employment equity survey. This represents 0.8% of our tenure-track and tenured academic staff.  A strategic hiring initiative was launched in 2020-2021 that issued 18 licenses across Faculties to enhance the representation of Black faculty and to recruit faculty with research and teaching expertise relevant to Black experiences, histories, communities. In the past year, 15 new Black faculty joined the McGill professoriate.  Terri Givens: This is one of the areas where I’m hoping to surpass our goal. Basically, you should look at that number as a baseline and if we go beyond that I will be more than thrilled. Over time, as we develop things like Black studies on campus, my goal is for McGill to become a beacon for people who are interested in the study of the African diaspora, Black studies, all these different components, you know not just Black Canada, but more broadly looking at the African diaspora. Basically, the more Black faculty join McGill, even more will be excited and interested in coming to McGill.   One goal of the EDI plan is to make the learning experience more inclusive. What success has Teaching and Learning Services (TLS) had in implementing this goal thus far?  Angela Campbell: Charlene Lewis-Sutherland, who’s been here at McGill a long time, particularly leading some of the anti-oppressive workshops in the residences, has taken on a position at TLS doing a great amount of this work, training instructors about how to build inclusive pedagogies and curricula. Her work has been important and powerful.  We also led an ad hoc working group last year that led to a decision to formalize a committee that will look at the issue of bias in student evaluations of teaching.   What’s the focus for year two of the AP-ABR?  Angela Campbell: Aside from sustaining the effort already initiated in the first year, we anticipate that year two will see a range of highlights, including the completion and submission of the African and Black Studies Working Group (ABSWG)’s report, implementing that report’s recommendations, launching the online module on systemic racism , the establishment of a research team to carry out an expanded McGill history project on our university’s connections to the transatlantic slave trade, and opening a dedicated campus space for Black students, among other things.  In the year ahead, the team leading work under the Action Plan will engage through multiple platforms to solicit feedback and ideas about areas where more work, or more effective work, is needed to advance the Action Plan’s objectives, in both letter and spirit.   Any final thoughts?  Terri Givens: I’m very happy to be here at McGill. I’ve been here since last July, and I had a fantastic experience teaching my course last fall on Comparative Immigration Politics. It’s been very interesting for the students to learn the comparative perspective on immigration. This term, I’ll be teaching my class on Transnational Black Race Issues. So as this shows, one of the things that bringing in Black faculty does is, of course, bring in a new perspective on various areas. I’ve been working in my field of political science more broadly, to increase our understanding of how race has been dealt with, even within our own profession over the history of the profession, so that’s going to be something we’ll be discussing in my class next term.  Angela Campbell: I’ll just say I’m so happy Terri’s here. It’s an exciting moment for McGill. We are already starting to see concrete outcomes, and I think that McGill is ready, willing, and able to take up the challenge of doing the work needed to sustain the change necessary to advance the Action Plan. It’s heavy lifting, so it’s not something that can just be accomplished by one workshop or any other one-off. This has to be an ongoing commitment to practice.","Thu, 01/27/2022 - 11:02"
Keeping brains fit longer,"January is Alzheimer’s Awareness Month and two new studies at the Clinical Research Unit at The Neuro are tackling cognitive decline with the goal of helping older Canadians remain independent longer. One study looks at how a computerized brain-training program may improve focus and the brain’s ability to stay in shape; the other is investigating a potential new therapeutic avenue in slowing the progression of early Alzheimer’s Disease.Gaming the brainAccording to the Alzheimer’s Society of Canada, almost 40 per cent of people over the age of 65 experience some form of memory loss, known as age-associated memory impairment. The accepted wisdom is that, in order to stave off further cognitive decline and possible dementia, we need to keep our brains active. But how do we know what really works to keep us sharp?“In my clinic, I see patients with memory problems, and they’re worried. They tell me that they are doing crossword puzzles every day; but we now know that crossword puzzles don’t do much,” explains Dr. Étienne de Villers-Sidani, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital). “In order to show benefit, we need a type of training that involves your senses, that involves your attention and that gets harder and harder over time.”Dr. de Villers-Sidani is the principal investigator for the INHANCE study taking place at the Neuro’s Clinical Research Unit. This study is looking at the impact of a computerized brain training program designed by Posit Science at UCSF that hopes to show improved neurological health by targeting speed and alertness training. The study will not only look at participants’ scores on standard measures of cognition, but will also evaluate their levels of acetylcholine, a chemical produced in the brain when we focus, through novel brain imaging techniques.“As we get older, the chemicals in the brain that are important for attention and for brain plasticity – meaning the ability of the brain to change – tend to go down naturally. And that process becomes accelerated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease,” says Dr. de Villers-Sidani.Powered by positronsIn 2017, the Alzheimer’s Association published the results of a 10-year study in the U.S. that found that individualized computerized brain training reduced the incidence of developing Alzheimer’s by almost 30 per cent. The INHANCE study aims to go one step further by examining whether this type of brain training can actually change the chemistry of the brain in a fundamental way.“There is no data out there on this. What we’re trying to do with this study by tracking acetylcholine is to demonstrate that the brain can upregulate, and increase its production of this very important chemical for healthy brain function,” explains Dr. de Villers-Sidani.Posit Science received funding from the National Institutes of Health in the US for the INHANCE study and contracted the Clinical Research Unit at The Neuro to conduct the trial. The Neuro is well known for its positron emission tomography (PET) unit, an emerging technology for the clinical evaluation of many disease processes.“The Neuro is one of the only places in the world that is equipped to measure levels of acetylcholine in the brain. The ligand – a molecule that binds to a receiving protein – that is used in the imaging was developed for the first time in collaboration with the PET unit at The Neuro. It’s only been used in a handful of other places in the world,” adds Dr. de Villers-Sidani.The INHANCE trial is looking for healthy participants over the age of 65 who would use this daily brain training program 30 minutes a day at home for several weeks. Anonymous data from the study will also be available following the end of the study in LORIS, an open science data-imaging platform at The Neuro that will allow researchers from around the world to request access to further their research.Dr. de Villers-Sidani is hopeful that this speed and alertness training could make a real difference. “If the results of the study are positive, that could have an impact on clinical management relatively soon, because this software already exists.”Treating Alzheimer’s earlyThe Alzheimer’s Society of Canada estimates that there are half a million people over the age of 65 living with dementia today, and that number is set to almost double in the next decade. Dementia is an umbrella term for a set of disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease, that impair brain function. The symptoms include a decline in memory, language and judgement; physical challenges with balance and movement; as well as changes in mood and behaviour. These are chronic conditions that gets more severe over time.The CRU at The Neuro is the only site in Quebec taking part in a major international trial testing a new medication that hopes to slow cognitive decline in participants who already have early Alzheimer’s Disease. This Phase II trial will test a potential new medication’s safety and as well its effects on the accumulation of tau protein in the brain.“There are two major abnormalities leading to symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. There are amyloid-beta plaques and there are neurofibrillary tangles caused by an accumulation of a protein called tau that collects inside neurons,” explains Dr. Simon Ducharme, a neuropsychiatrist and the director of the Geriatric Psychiatry Division at McGill University, who is the principal investigator on the AuTonomy clinical trial at The Neuro.Tangling with tau“The interesting thing about tau is that it accumulates in the places in the brain related to symptoms – for instance the memory centres around the hippocampus – while beta-amyloid plaques are more dispersed. There is therefore an important link between these accumulations and the actual symptoms of dementia. Yet the approach of targeting tau has been much less explored in trials testing new treatments,” says Dr. Ducharme.To date, the great majority of studies testing new medications to treat Alzheimer’s have focussed on amyloid-beta and they largely have not been successful at slowing disease. A recently approved medication showed mild slowing of disease progression, but patients continued to deteriorate on the treatment. “The hope is that by targeting tau, this study will lead to a disease modifying therapy, one that can stabilize or significantly slow down the progression of the disease,” says Dr. Ducharme.The AuTonomy study is for those with early stage Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with evidence of elevated brain tau. This is a stage where patients have biological changes in their brain and may experience memory loss, word finding issues and difficulty with orientation. “At this stage we can see from the biological tests that these issues are caused by Alzheimer’s disease in the brain, but these individuals remain fairly independent,” explains Dr. Ducharme.The experimental medication tested in the AuTonomy study is innovative; it is testing a passive antibody mechanism that binds to specific forms of phosphorylated Tau to facilitate its elimination by the brain’s microglia. In other words, it has the potential to decrease the spreading of tau in the brain, which could slow down disease progression.“There is probably going to be a point where we can combine these different approaches – amyloid-beta and anti-Tau. Our current research is really building the arsenal to slow down the progression of the disease. The ultimate goal would be to see a stabilization of Alzheimer’s Disease,” concludes Dr. Ducharme.For more information on these two studies, contact the neurocognitive team at the Clinical Research Unit at The Neuro at info-cru.neuro@mcgill.ca or visit cru.mcgill.ca/ad_en. Garder le cerveau en forme plus longtempsDe nouvelles études passionnantes au Neuro étudient un programme d’entraînement cérébral ciblé et un nouveau traitement potentiel pour le stade précoce de la maladie d’AlzheimerJanvier est le mois de la sensibilisation à la maladie d’Alzheimer et deux nouvelles études à l’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro (URC) s’attaquent au déclin cognitif dans le but d’aider les Canadiens à rester indépendants plus longtemps. Une des études examine comment un programme d’entraînement cérébral informatisé peut améliorer la concentration et la capacité du cerveau à rester en forme ; l’autre étude se penche une nouvelle voie potentielle pour ralentir la progression de la maladie d’Alzheimer précoce.Déjouer le cerveauSelon la Société Alzheimer du Canada, près de 40 % des personnes de plus de 65 ans souffrent d’une forme quelconque de perte de mémoire, connue sous le nom de trouble de la mémoire lié à l’âge. Les conseils d’experts indiquent que nous devons rester actifs mentalement pour éviter un déclin cognitif et une éventuelle démence. Mais comment savons-nous ce qui fonctionne vraiment pour garder un cerveau agile et vif d’esprit?« Dans ma clinique, je vois des patients qui ont des problèmes de mémoire et ils sont inquiets. Ils me disent qu’ils font des mots croisés tous les jours ; mais on sait maintenant que les mots croisés ne servent pas à grand-chose », explique le Dr Étienne de Villers-Sidani, neurologue spécialisé en troubles cognitifs au Neuro (Institut-Hôpital neurologique de Montréal). « Afin de montrer des avantages, nous avons besoin d’un type d’entraînement qui implique vos sens, qui implique votre attention et qui devient de plus en plus difficile avec le temps. »Le Dr de Villers-Sidani est le chercheur principal de l’étude INHANCE qui se déroule à l’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro. Cette étude examine l’impact d’un programme d’entraînement cérébral informatisé conçu par Posit Science à l’Université de Californie à San Francisco qui espère montrer une amélioration de la santé neurologique en ciblant un entraînement de l’agilité et la vivacité mentale. L’étude examinera non seulement les résultats des participants sur les mesures cognitives standardisées, mais évaluera également leur niveau d’acétylcholine, une substance chimique produite dans le cerveau lorsque nous nous concentrons.“En vieillissant, les substances chimiques du cerveau qui sont importantes pour l’attention et la plasticité cérébrale — c’est-à-dire la capacité du cerveau à changer — ont tendance à diminuer naturellement. Et ce processus s’accélère dans un certain nombre de troubles neurodégénératifs, comme la maladie d’Alzheimer », explique le Dr de Villers-Sidani.Puissance par positronsEn 2017, l’Association Alzheimer a publié les résultats d’une étude sur 10 ans aux États-Unis qui a révélé qu’un entraînement cérébral informatisé individualisé réduisait l’incidence de développer la maladie d’Alzheimer de près de 30 %. L’étude INHANCE vise à aller plus loin, en examinant si ce type d’entraînement cérébral peut réellement modifier la chimie du cerveau de manière fondamentale.“Il n’y a pas de données à ce sujet. Ce que nous essayons de faire avec cette étude en mesurant l’acétylcholine, c’est de démontrer que le cerveau peut réguler positivement et augmenter sa production de ce produit chimique très important pour le bon fonctionnement du cerveau », explique le Dr de Villers-Sidani.Posit Science a reçu un financement des National Institutes of Health aux États-Unis pour l’étude INHANCE et a engagé l’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro pour mener l’essai. Le Neuro est bien connu pour son unité de tomographie par émission de positrons (TEP), une technologie émergente pour l’évaluation clinique de nombreux processus pathologiques.« Le Neuro est l’un des seuls endroits au monde équipé pour mesurer les niveaux d’acétylcholine dans le cerveau. Le ligand — une molécule qui se lie à une protéine réceptrice — qui est utilisé dans l’imagerie a été développé pour la première fois en collaboration avec l’unité TEP du Neuro. Il n’a été utilisé que dans une poignée d’autres endroits dans le monde », ajoute le Dr de Villers-Sidani.L’essai INHANCE recherche des participants en bonne santé âgés de plus de 65 ans qui utiliseraient ce programme d’entraînement cérébral quotidien 30 minutes par jour à la maison pendant plusieurs semaines. Les données anonymes de l’étude seront également disponibles dans LORIS, une plateforme d’imagerie scientifique ouverte au Neuro qui permettra aux chercheurs du monde entier de demander l’accès pour poursuivre leurs recherches.Le Dr de Villers-Sidani espère que cet entraînement pour l’agilité et la vivacité mentale pourra faire une réelle différence. « Si les résultats de l’étude sont positifs, cela pourrait avoir un impact sur la gestion clinique assez rapidement, car ce logiciel existe déjà. »Traiter la maladie d’Alzheimer plus précocementLa Société Alzheimer du Canada estime qu’il y a un demi-million de personnes de plus de 65 ans atteintes de démence aujourd’hui, et que ce nombre devrait presque doubler au cours de la prochaine décennie. La démence est un terme générique désignant un ensemble de troubles, y compris la maladie d’Alzheimer, qui altèrent les fonctions cérébrales. Les symptômes comprennent un déclin de la mémoire, du langage et du jugement; des défis physiques avec l’équilibre et le mouvement; ainsi que des changements d’humeur et de comportement. Ce sont des troubles chroniques qui s’aggravent avec le temps.L’URC du Neuro est le seul site au Québec à participer à un essai international majeur testant un nouveau médicament qui espère ralentir le déclin cognitif chez les participants déjà atteints de la maladie d’Alzheimer au stade précoce. Cet essai de phase II testera l’innocuité d’un nouveau médicament potentiel ainsi que ses effets sur l’accumulation de la protéine tau dans le cerveau.«Il existe deux anomalies majeures entraînant des symptômes dans la maladie d’Alzheimer. Il y a des plaques de bêta-amyloïde et il y a des enchevêtrements neurofibrillaires causés par une accumulation d’une protéine appelée tau qui s’accumule à l’intérieur des neurones », explique le Dr Simon Ducharme, neuropsychiatre et directeur de la Division de gérontopsychiatrie de l’Université McGill, qui est le principal chercheur de l’essai clinique AuTonomy au Neuro.La protéine tau dans la mire« Ce qui est intéressant à propos de la protéine tau est qu’elle s’accumule dans les endroits du cerveau liés aux symptômes, par exemple le centre de la mémoire autour de l’hippocampe, tandis que les plaques de bêta-amyloïde sont plus dispersées. Il y a donc un lien très important entre ces accumulations et les symptômes réels de la démence. Pourtant, l’approche de cibler la protéine tau a été beaucoup moins explorée en termes d’essais cliniques testant de nouveaux traitements », explique le Dr Ducharme.À ce jour, la grande majorité des études testant de nouveaux médicaments pour traiter la maladie d’Alzheimer se sont concentrées sur la bêta-amyloïde et elles n’ont en grande partie pas réussi à ralentir la maladie. Un médicament récemment approuvé a montré un léger ralentissement de la progression, mais les patients ont continué à se détériorer malgré le traitement. « Nous espérons qu’en ciblant la protéine tau, cette étude débouchera sur une thérapie modificatrice de la maladie, qui pourra stabiliser ou ralentir la progression de la maladie », explique le Dr Ducharme.L’étude AuTonomy s’adresse aux personnes atteintes de la maladie d’Alzheimer à un stade précoce ou de trouble cognitif légèr présentant des signes de tau cérébral élevé. À cette étape, les patients ont des changements biologiques dans leur cerveau et peuvent éprouver des pertes de mémoire, des difficultés à chercher des mots et des troubles de l’orientation. « À ce stade, on peut voir sur les tests biologiques que ces problèmes sont causés par la maladie d’Alzheimer au niveau du cerveau, mais ces individus demeurent relativement indépendants », explique le Dr Ducharme. Le médicament expérimental testé dans l’étude AuTonomy est innovant ; il teste un mécanisme d’anticorps passif qui se lie à des formes spécifiques de Tau phosphorylé pour faciliter son élimination par le cerveau grâce aux cellules microgliales. En d’autres termes, il a le potentiel de diminuer la propagation de tau dans le cerveau, ce qui pourrait ralentir la progression de la maladie.« Il y aura probablement un moment où nous pourrons combiner ces différentes approches – bêta-amyloïde et anti-Tau. Nos recherches actuelles construisent vraiment l’arsenal pour ralentir la progression de la maladie. Le but ultime serait de voir une stabilisation de la maladie d’Alzheimer », conclut le Dr Ducharme.Pour plus d’information sur ces deux essais, contacter l’équipe neurocognitive de l’Unité de recherche clinique du Neuro à info-cru.neuro@mcgill.ca ou visitez cru.mcgill.ca/fr/ad_fr/.","Wed, 01/26/2022 - 17:39"
Sustainable Sparks: Ingrid Birker on connecting the stories of the past with the voices of the future,"“When you visit a museum and take the time to be mindful. You leave that building with more than you did when you entered,” says Ingrid Birker. “This moment of pause is where we integrate knowledge. You never know how much that extra time with the past can change the way you see the future.”Kelsey Litwin Charged with sharing the wonders of science and history of McGill with the public and tackling the barriers between museums and communities, Science Outreach Administrator Ingrid Birker has been involved in nearly too many sustainable projects on campus to count.From teaching children to leading McGill’s inaugural Climate Change Artist in Residence, there is nothing Birker won’t try to bring the museum to the world outside of the Roddick Gates. Nearing her retirement, Birker shares her insight of the role of memory institutions in sustainability in a sit-down with the Office of Sustainability.As the Science Outreach Administrator at the Redpath Museum, you have a unique opportunity to connect communities on campus. Tell us about some of the experiences you’ve had while in this position.When my position was created in 2006, I remember [being told],”know our scientists do a really good job within the Roddick Gates, but … we have a duty to provide the public with a chance to hear about science. I want you to take all of the amazing science that happens here and bring it beyond the gates.'”Since then, we have built lots of different initiatives to do just that.One of my first experiences working with McGill Office of Sustainability (MOOS) was through community gardening. We would all meet over lunchtime. And it was a great way for all the disparate groups of people working at McGill in the summer to meet and be together outside. Being in a garden lets you feel more energized because you are around living tissues which are breathing and growing and creating so much positive energy. You just can’t help to feel good. Sustainable gardens at McGill is more than just gardening – it makes you feel good about the land and working at a downtown campus that cares about health, welfare and environmental stability. The project was about sustainable gardening but being there you got the sense it was the start of something really important.You have been involved in several projects through the Sustainability Projects Fund (SPF). What was one of your favourites?I think my favourite experience was SP014 which was called Water is Life. It was about building these normally very traditional exhibits about water but placing them out in the community instead of hiding them away in the museum.This was my first experience working on a SPF [project], and immediately felt very different from other grant systems. When you get a grant from other agencies, it’s usually administered remotely, and you just took the funding and completed the project. Working with MOOS was completely different. We talked frequently and worked on the project together. This taught me a new style of working with someone who isn’t just an investor but is a stakeholder who cares about the result as much as you do.It creates so much more beautiful and thoughtful collaboration – it can sometimes take a bit longer – but it’s always been more than worth it. I think more than anything it allows people to feel like they are part of a story instead of just telling it.Memory institutions like museums are some of the oldest public gathering places. How have you seen memory institutions change with the needs and interest of the community?The past 20 years or so have brought a very distinctive change. Museums used to be very closed off with rigid purpose and have become much more of a community experience. We started to become much more community oriented. [Museums are] not just a place to borrow books and read posters, but maybe somewhere you could go to experience things as a family.This cultural shift meant our purpose grew to after-hour social occasions, dates, and birthdays. I think it’s a huge change, the museums and cultural institutions as a whole have come to terms with facilitating an experience that is more inclusive for different audiences.Museums have historically been a place that are not always socially welcoming to everyone. Why are outreach positions like yours important in making memory institutions more inclusive spaces?This is a tough one, and sometimes trying to find a solution without being thoughtful can sort of feel like social greenwashing. When you’re acknowledging the land, for example, do you just add it to the bottom of your brochure, or do you actually go up to every visitor and engage with them about the traditional territory you are on?And this point of connection with a visitor if you do make that effort… Who gets to hear it? It’s a privilege to have easy access to a museum. In order to learn and see your history, you need to visit a certain building between specific times and pay a fee. This makes it harder to access knowledge that’s supposed to be public. Sure, institutions are here to preserve our cultural and natural heritage, but we are also responsible for sharing this heritage with the community.That’s what outreach is for – it’s to build connections in the community and help break down the silos within museums. That means you have to go out into the world and share with the community on their terms. You can’t expect everyone to be able to come into our spaces, so by bringing the museum to the community, we can start to remove some of these barriers.Why do you think it’s important to include these memory institutions in conversations about sustainability?I’m reminded of the Seventh Generation Haudenosaunee Principle, which is the philosophy that the decisions we make today should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future. A memory institution’s job is to hold the stories and objects of our cultures and preserve them. And looking forward, especially in sustainability, I don’t think we can really change things without knowing and learning from the past. Yes, we are memory keepers, but if there is going to be a future with any kind of meaning, we have to think of where we are coming from, and who will learn from the actions we take now in the future.If you had one message about sustainability at McGill, what would it be?I think it would just be to be mindful. When you’re learning – and we are always learning – take a moment to think on it.Our society is very task-driven and doesn’t always have time set aside for mindfulness. There’s a lot of conditioning to produce something, but it’s so important to pause and leave room for reflection. And that’s what memory institutions should really be for: A place for reflection.When you visit a museum and take the time to be mindful, you leave that building with more than you did when you entered. This moment of pause is where we integrate knowledge. You never know how much that extra time with the past can change the way you see the future.","Wed, 01/26/2022 - 09:00"
McGill ranks among Canada’s elite medical research universities,"According to the annual Canada’s Top 50 Research Universities rankings issued earlier today, McGill is the second-best Medical Research University in the nation. This marks the second consecutive year that McGill was ranked No.2.Compiled by Research Infosource, the rankings are based on six indicators including total sponsored research income; research intensity per faculty; research intensity per graduate student; total number of publications; publication intensity; and publication impact. McGill was the only university in Canada to rank in the top three in all six indicators in the Medical Research University category.“Growth in McGill’s research income and intensity translates to tangible benefits to societal health and wellbeing, as well as advances in knowledge and innovation,” said Martha Crago, Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation. “Our high position on the Research InfoSource Inc. list of Canada’s Top 50 Research Universities is a testament to the exceptionally high caliber of McGill’s research community – an accomplishment we should all celebrate.”According to the Research Infosource, Canada’s top 50 research universities posted combined research income of $8.27 billion in Fiscal 2020, a gain of 3.0 per cent over Fiscal 2019. McGill gained 3.7 per cent over that period.Average research intensity – research income per faculty position – was $202,900 among the nation’s top research universities in Fiscal 2020. McGill’s research intensity per faculty position for 2020 was $344,100, third best in the nation.Graduate student intensity – research income per graduate student – averaged $39,000 among Canada’s top universities, a slight decline from Fiscal 2019. However, over that same period, McGill’s graduate research intensity grew by 2.07 per cent, standing at $63,500 per graduate student – best among G5 universities.Research Infosource is a leading source of ranking information on research universities, corporations, hospitals and colleges that are used and followed by the research and innovation community, opinion and policy leaders in the government, research, corporate, higher education and non-profit sectors.Read the Research Infosource press release.","Tue, 01/25/2022 - 14:15"
Keep your research data safe and organized ,"In their efforts to push the boundaries of knowledge, researchers face many challenges – including how to manage and share research data in a meaningful way that could facilitate the research process and ensure data are being collected, recorded, and stored properly and securely.“Effective data management is increasingly recognized as being critical for quality research,” says David Buckeridge, Professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health; Chief Digital Health Officer, McGill University Health Centre; Scientific Lead, Data Management and Analytics, COVID-19 Immunity Task Force. “A major reason is that ensuring the integrity and security of research data is necessary for reproducible and transparent research. Sound data management practices are also important for continued public trust and maintaining compliance with Canadian and international laws and regulations, as well as policies of funding agencies and publishers.”RDM (Research Data Management) is both an academic discipline and a set of methodological guidelines involving the planning, organizing, describing, storing, and sharing of research data in a secure fashion. Good RDM practices help researchers become more efficient in their work and ensure timely production and dissemination of quality research to be used and reused by others.Why should you care about RDM? Data loss in a research project happens more often than researchers anticipate. Good RDM practices will allow researchers to prospectively plan and identify resources, anticipate roadblocks, and implement procedures for appropriate data access and backups to prevent data loss. This new online RDM learning program helps researchers plan for a variety of RDM activities, including secure data storage that could be shared among students and researchers, proper documentation within a research project and correct labelling and organization of research data files so that the research and research data can be understood and reused in months or years to come.Who can enroll in the program? The program is freely available to McGill Principal Investigators (PIs), research associates and assistants, technicians, research support staff and students at all levels.

McGill named one of the world’s most international universities,"McGill has a long-standing reputation as being one of the world’s most diverse institutions. That reputation was further solidified last week after McGill was named the 28th most international university in the world, and second in Canada, by Times Higher Education (THE).The THE list was compiled based on institutions’ international student score, international staff score, international co-authorship score and international reputation metrics collected for the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The World University Rankings analyses over 1,600 universities.Strength in diversityDiversity has always been one of McGill’s strengths. Traditionally, International students make up some 30 per cent of the University’s student body. This year, there are almost 12,000 international students enrolled at McGill, representing over 150 countries (see the table at the end of the article).“International students bring so much cultural and linguistic diversity to the campus, the classroom and student life. The Students’ Society of McGill University is home to over 80 student clubs that target international students,” says Pauline L’Ecuyer, Director of International Student Services (ISS) and The MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program. “Students are always fascinated to find so many other students from their home country at McGill.”ISS provides international students with a wide range of support that begins even before they arrive in Canada and, in some cases, years after they graduate.As early as March, ISS invites newly admitted students to attend a series of pre-arrival webinars covering immigration procedures; health insurance and access to healthcare in Quebec; and travel tips (now including vaccination requirements, travel restrictions, quarantine).Peer mentorshipISS also offers a pair of popular peer-mentor programs.The Buddy program – “probably the ancestor of peer-mentor programs at McGill,” says L’Ecuyer – matches International students with an upper year student with a similar profile (citizenship, language, Faculty, Graduate vs Undergraduate, etc.).In 2020, ISS introduced a new First Friend Program. The initiative began as a program to match new students studying remotely with another new student in the same time-zone.“This summer, the First Friend Program will match new international students from the same region to connect, before they even arrive at McGill,” says L’Ecuyer. “They goal of this new strategy is to help students relieve immigration stress or even make plans to travel to Montreal together so they have a friend at McGill, even before arriving in Montreal.”Orientation workshops, immigration supportOnce students arrive in Montreal, they have access to a series of ISS workshops to help them better understand and adapt to their new environment. Since 2020, Jos Porter, ISS Local Wellness Advisor, has been delivering a series of workshops on student wellness, mental health and navigating the health care system in Quebec.ISS also boasts a dedicated team of four licensed immigration specialists, who help students facing issues with their immigration documents (applying, renewing, supporting dependents, etc.)Finally, for the past five years, ISS has partnered with Université du Québec à Chicoutimi to offer the fully-funded McGill-Chicoutimi French Immigration Program to help international students transition to the work force either during or after their studies at McGill. Pre-pandemic, students would spend five weeks, living with a family in Saguenay, attending the Explore program and conducting industry site visits – completely in French. Since the onset of the pandemic, the program has been offered online but L’Ecuyer says the plan is to be back in-person this summer.Rounding out its extensive support, ISS offers an array of immigration programming, including Post-Graduation Work Permit, Working in Canada, and Renewing Immigration Documents. ISS also collaborates with the Quebec’s Ministry of Immigration, Francisation and Integration; and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to offer students information on how to apply for Permanent Residence.Adapting to the challenges of COVIDAt the onset of the COVID pandemic, ISS adapted rapidly in order to keep supporting their clients at that critical juncture. “We quickly turned to Zoom immigration appointments and remote workshops in the first year but we have been back on campus and offering hybrid services since August 2021,” says L’Ecuyer. “We have had to become very agile and quickly update our website with the latest information about entering and leaving Canada.L’Ecuyer credits her team’s creativity in keeping ISS programs running, offering online social activities such as trivia events; a Montreal scavenger hunt; and art programs with the McGill Wellness Hub for students with families. In December, ISS hosted a remote gingerbread house competition.“For many of our workshops, we noticed that the attendance was better attended virtually than in-person,” says L’Ecuyer. “So, we will definitely keep this hybrid model of delivery in the coming years.”Consult THE’s Most International Universities in the World rankings","Mon, 01/24/2022 - 16:46"
McGill ready to resume in-person teaching,"Earlier this month, Premier François Legault announced that Quebec universities could restart full in-person academic activities on Jan. 17. Starting Monday, Jan. 24, McGill will resume in-person classes for most teaching activities. To help the transition, instructors have the discretion to still teach up to 20 per cent of a course remotely, without additional authorization from their Chair or Director. Most lectures with more than 200 students will remain online.Professors Fabrice Labeau, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), and Christopher Buddle, Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs), spoke to the Reporter about what to expect from the return to in-person, accommodations, the many layers of protection McGill has in place for maintaining a safe environment and continuing the University’s commitment to in-person academics. The Quebec government allowed universities to resume their in-person activities starting Jan. 17. Why did McGill decide to wait an extra week?Christopher Buddle: We could have started back on the 17th, but we wanted instructors to have more time to prepare, and everyone a chance to get ready for the full return. In some disciplines, they’re very ready and want to go back to regular in-person classes on Monday, and in other areas, more of a progression is needed from a pedagogical point of view. Although there is advanced notice, it’s still very complicated to make that transition from online to in-person.What can we expect the week of Jan. 24 to look like?Fabrice Labeau: We expect in-person teaching and learning, and also research, to be happening progressively to make the transition smoother. With the 20 per cent discretion, we know many professors will be still teaching some courses online next week.Buddle: Obviously, we haven’t had anywhere near our “normal” numbers of people on campus this semester, but it’s important to remember that our campuses haven’t been empty either. Since the semester began on Jan. 3, between 6,000 and 10,000 people have been on McGill’s campuses every day for research, and for teaching and learning activities in the health sciences and music, among other disciplines. There has already been quite a bit of in-person activity.Labeau: And that really speaks to how successful the University has been in adhering to two main principles since the start of the pandemic: prioritizing the safety and well-being of our community, and staying true to our academic mission.I sent several MRO messages to the community last week, to help people get ready for next week. One of the things I emphasized was how safe Quebec’s universities have been throughout the Fall. Across Quebec, very few people caught the coronavirus through on-campus activities. At McGill during the Fall semester, there was no evidence that anyone caught the virus through contacts in a classroom—even though 85% of our teaching activities were in person. In the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) outbreak data for mid-December, for example, a period when there was a lot of in-person activity on Quebec campuses, and Omicron cases were beginning to rise sharply, outbreaks in Quebec universities only accounted for 0.1% of the outbreaks across Quebec.The University requires procedural masks to be worn indoors and doesn’t allow cloth masks unless they’re layered over a procedural. There’s a lot of talk right now about the efficacy of procedurals versus N95 masks. Can you talk about the differences?Labeau: There’s a lot of confusion out there about what literature to follow. I would advise everybody to look at a report issued recently by the INSPQ. It is a compilation of all the literature about the different masks.There’s no doubt that an N95 mask is better at isolating particles than a procedural mask, and a procedural mask is better than a cloth mask. And, of course, full-face respirators are better than N95 masks.But the question at the end of the day is what is the suitable protection for your particular setting? And that report, which is corroborated by medical experts, says that there are not many settings in a university environment that justify wearing an N95 mask.Wearing an N95 mask typically makes the most sense in a healthcare setting where people interact very closely with patients who have a very high likelihood of being positive. Those are not the conditions at a university. That’s not our level of risk.Speaking of interventions, how will the University ensure that people follow safety directives such as social distancing and wearing masks?Labeau: In the Fall, we had anywhere between 25,000 and 28,000 people on campus every day. We expect a similar load on our campus in the Winter term.In the Fall, we had security patrols and safety ambassadors who made us aware of “hotspots,” where we saw less adherence to directives; we increased the patrols in these areas. We’re going to go with something very similar for the Winter.This kind of presence leads to an overall environment with a very high degree of respect for the directives. Of course, it’s never 100 per cent, but that’s why we have the patrols.Can you talk more about the increased on-campus density, and how that will work for maintaining social distancing?Labeau: For now, we are limiting the presence of administrative and support staff to the people who directly support the activities that take place on campus or who cannot do their work from home. This will allow us to lower the density of administrative and support staff on campus compared to the end of the Fall.There are all sorts of possible configurations for administrative or support staff on campus but, typically, the directives regarding masking are the same. People have to wear masks all the time, even when they are seated and two meters away from somebody else. The only time someone can remove their mask is alone in an enclosed room or office.Because we aren’t calling back too many people to campus, it will greatly reduce the density in offices and administrative spaces. It’s going to make distancing a lot easier.In spaces like cafeterias, for instance, there are precise directives. At present, we can have six people per table and one meter between tables. That’s a reduction from the Fall when it was 10 people.What accommodations are in place for teaching staff who cannot teach 80 per cent of their courses in person?Labeau: It will depend on the reasons, of course. For immunocompromised individuals, we have the usual accommodations that were in place last semester. That, typically, would be the main reason for these kinds of accommodations.Buddle: Yes, there’s still a process to make sure that people who require the accommodations with respect to, for example, more chronic or long-term conditions – that’s available to them, as it has been since the start of the pandemic. In those cases, I’ll add that the types of accommodation also vary, depending on the teaching context and the Faculty. It’s not a one-size-fits-all, and I really don’t think it should be because it needs to be case-dependent and reflective of the sorts of accommodations that an individual might need.One of the things we always need to recognize at McGill is that there’s a lot of variation by Faculty, and for good reasons. Take clinical training in a hospital setting, for example. That won’t work remotely. The same is true for some of the performance areas in music. It was really important that Faculties were able to develop their own protocols that match their teaching and learning contexts. That’s why there are some differences across Faculties. The general principle is 20%, but some Faculties have adopted slightly different approaches.Can you talk about how the University is working to provide accommodations for students?Buddle: There are two parts to think about. One is the short-term absences because of students having COVID, or having to self-isolate. Those accommodations, in most cases, will be at the instructors’ discretion, and they’ll try to find a way to make sure a student doesn’t fall behind in a class. Last Fall, the evidence that we’ve heard from Faculties and the Dean of Students is that the process for short-term accommodations worked reasonably well. Instructors were very flexible in finding ways to support students that requested short-term absences. That process is still in place for this term. We’re strongly promoting the idea that all instructors record their materials, whenever they can, for the benefit of students needing a short-term accommodation.As for longer-term accommodations, it’s really a case-by-case approach because it has to match the individual issues that a student might bring forward. If there is a situation where a student requires support longer-term, then the Office of the Dean of Students will work with the Office for Students with Disabilities [OSD] to look at the individual case to see what can be reasonably put in place.The key part here is, what do we mean by “reasonable”? From the perspective of OSD, it really means accommodations that do not put in place undue hardship. But there might be some contexts where it’s simply not possible. For example, in certain kinds of training where hands-on competencies are necessary to complete the course, an accommodation just might not be possible. I would generally say, though, the Office of the Dean of Students certainly works hard on a case-by-case basis to find a strategy for students that need accommodations.Labeau: That’s a very good description of what we mean when we say “reasonable.” But I think the kinds of things we’re talking about are also accommodations that do not significantly change the way academic standards of a course are established. This is an extreme example, but if the request for accommodation is to not have exams in a course, we would say no to that. So, it’s very difficult to give you an answer that kind of covers every possible situation, because indeed, it’s on a case-by-case basis, and it depends on the course, on the method of evaluation, the types of conditions, and the length of the accommodation period.Buddle: I understand why this is a source of confusion for some students and why it isn’t easy to navigate for some students, because it is very complex. We have 40,000 students with so many different kinds of programs and different contexts for reaching the learning objectives that it’s really hard to have a one-size-fits-all, simple, straightforward process for those more complex accommodation needs.When it comes to deciding what entails a reasonable accommodation, how much autonomy does an instructor have?Labeau: The general principles are set by the University, and also the external rules we are subject to, and then the instructor is the person who is most knowledgeable about the material and the pedagogical aspect of the call. They know if a course was designed to be mainly in-person with a lot of group work, for instance, despite it not being a hands-on course. So having that kind of course be online, where a student can’t be in a group the whole semester, defeats the purpose of the whole pedagogical setup. That’s an instructor choice that may have a bearing on what can be done in terms of a reasonable accommodation.Some requests are not so simple, and we have people in the Dean of Students Office and the Office for Students with Disabilities who really work with the students and with the instructor to find a way to make the situation as normal as possible.You mentioned that short-term accommodations worked well in the Fall semester. Did other experiences from Fall help inform the planning for the return to in-person teaching this month?Labeau: Of course, today’s context is different from that of the Fall. We’re dealing with a different variant, a different impact in terms of being vaccinated or not, three doses versus two doses.But there are huge similarities in that we see a lot of anxiety about coming back. If you go back to the summer, just before the start of the Fall semester, we heard the same kind of anxiety around the idea of coming back, and that’s completely natural because we were basically starting our first semester that would be mostly in-person since the start of the pandemic. This time around, we’re trying to go back to in-person activity after going through a major wave of a new variant of the virus, with a lot more added restrictions in society. So naturally, a lot of anxiety is building up around this.The level of anxiety is still very high, but it’s important to remember that, last Fall, things settled down after a couple of weeks. When you look back, it was a very successful semester overall. It was way more successful than a lot of people anticipated before the semester.Last Fall, what was driving the management of the pandemic was the idea of making sure, as much as possible, that nobody would contract the virus. Now, the public health approach is more the idea that we all have to start living with the virus, and that there may be some contamination from time to time, but there will be a limited impact on individuals. I think that’s also the way we should all look at this as we restart in-person activity now. We will continue to keep those extra measures of care we put in place for the Fall in place this time around, to make sure we have all those layers of protection.I think some changes that will be very visible to members of our community point to the different way of managing the pandemic by the public health department here in Quebec. For instance, contact tracing used to be very detailed. But now, with Omicron being much more contagious, contact tracing is done by the individual who tests positive; they’re the ones who identify their significant contacts and tell them what to do.From a McGill perspective, we are still asking people to call our Case Management Group when someone tests positive, so we make sure they know exactly what the processes are.You might have also noticed that the isolation instructions have changed since the beginning of the pandemic. Back then, whenever you had to isolate because you tested positive, or if you were a significant contact of someone who tested positive, you had to isolate for 14 days. That became 10 days, and now, for a lot of people, it’s five days. That’s related to how we’re managing the pandemic, and what the impact of being positive means for individuals and for society in general. So, we’re basically adapting to all these different ways of dealing with a pandemic, but we still have layers of protection, most of all.Buddle: On the teaching side, an important change that we’ve seen over the course of the pandemic is providing the right kind of framework for decisions that are pedagogically sound – a change in terms of looking at how we can offer some increased flexibility for instructors who would like to do more blended learning, and also take into account some of the needs to be more flexible in the modality of delivery.I think we’re also seeing big trends in examinations. Compared to pre-pandemic, we reduced the number of final exam seats by a third in the Fall; I think we had about 40,000 exam seatings in the Fall versus 60,000 in 2019. I expect that trend will continue as well.I think there are some big shifts with respect to the teaching and learning that have happened through the Fall, and we’re continuing with those in the Winter term.Are teaching flexibility and decreasing exam seatings trends McGill might pursue permanently?Buddle: There are certain trends that are very positive from a teaching and learning perspective. But it’s not about the administration deciding. It’s about what makes sense from the teaching and learning perspective – which has to be done in partnerships with the Faculties and the instructors.What we’ve heard from instructors is a desire to have the right kinds of parameters and guidelines so that they can adapt their pedagogical approach in a way that makes sense across the University and also locally.Would the University consider making it mandatory for instructors to record all their lectures?Buddle: It’s not as simple as an on/off switch. There are some contexts where it’s just not possible to record things virtually.In a recent MRO, there were examples of when a virtual version of something is just not possible, and that’s not even the full extent of it. There are other kinds of teaching activities that can’t be easily captured online, as opposed to a large lecture that might have a very passive delivery for certain kinds of content. In the end, the quality of those teaching experiences is just not there if it’s done virtually.We’re not in a position to mandate recording, but we are absolutely in a position to strongly encourage it whenever possible, especially for those lectures that can be more easily captured online. We continue to work very closely with the Faculties to strongly encourage lecture recording, and we find in most cases that instructors are very happy to do that, especially in a lot of the larger classes. There’s a real recognition of the value of those recordings.Under what conditions could the Winter 2022 semester move back to mostly online?Labeau: Every decision we make is based on different factors. Of course, if provincial guidelines tell us we need to decrease the level of in-person activities, we will follow them.We know that higher education is a priority for the government, and keeping us in-person is important.That being said, we will have to look at that from the perspective of all our backup plans. As with our planning for the Fall semester, there are steps down from the level of activity that is nominal. We would resort to these steps if we need to do that.For example, starting Monday we will be working with no distancing in classrooms. However, if things were to go south, we can always go back to one-meter distancing in classrooms. Of course, this would mean fewer in-person classes. But we definitely don’t want to go there, unless it’s necessary.We will be monitoring the situation in the province, in Montreal, and at McGill to figure out what is necessary. Balancing the risks is not a trivial equation where you just look at a number and say “Going by that number, this is what we’ll do.” It’s a much more complex decision that takes into account predictions, the number of cases, number of hospitalizations, and the situation at McGill. It’s not a straightforward decision.Buddle: There are a variety of factors that change over time. The metrics that we relied on a year ago are very different than the metrics we use now.Labeau: Here’s an example. We set up a dashboard in the Fall that displayed a lot of different metrics to our community. People could follow the situation at McGill based on things such as how many cases we were tracing at McGill, and how many contacts we could identify. But we don’t have a good handle on these kinds of metrics anymore because of the testing situation in the province. There’s no centralized governmental way of getting tested and confirming a positive case anymore. Before, everybody had to get a PCR tests to be told if they were positive. In the Fall, we had the exact case count for McGill, just like public health had the exact count of positive people in the province. This is no longer the case.So we will continue reporting the number of cases, but it’s going to be an approximation. We’re still asking people to tell us if they tested positive, but they may or may not do it. So, we will be watching the trends. Are we getting more calls this week than the previous week, or is it going down?That will give us a sense of the trends at McGill, although we will never have access to the absolute number of cases.Our dashboard is evolving; some measurements have disappeared because they’re no longer meaningful. We will try to give more metrics that will indicate to our community where we stand.","Sat, 01/22/2022 - 21:56"

Masters student wins Centre culturel islamique de Québec Memorial Award,"Master’s student Sarah Abou-Bakr is this year’s recipient of the Centre culturel islamique de Québec (CCIQ) Memorial Award, for her efforts to promote awareness and understanding of the Muslim experience in Quebec and Canada.Each year, the CCIQ Memorial Award is awarded to a McGill student who shows commitment to fostering the inclusion of Muslims within the larger Quebecois and Canadian societies. The award was established in 2018, in memory of the six men who were murdered and the 19 others injured on Jan. 29, 2017, shortly after Sunday evening prayers at the Quebec City mosque.Deeply involvedAbou-Bakr says she learned quickly about anti-Muslim discrimination while growing up in Montreal, and from a young age, she’s been deeply involved in efforts to raise awareness about Muslim issues and speaking out against Islamophobia in the wider community. Currently, with McGill’s Institute for Islamic Studies, she’s preparing her master’s thesis on Islamophobia in Quebec over the last decade.Sarah Abou-Bakr is writing her master’s thesis on Islamophobia in Quebec over the last decadeDuring her undergraduate years, she worked at Concordia University’s legal information clinic. She also led the planning and organization of community consultations, events, and workshops specifically related to contemporary Muslim issues in Quebec, such as Bill 21 (the controversial secularism law), Bill 64 (which overhauls Quebec’s privacy laws), and the aftermath of the 2017 mosque shooting. Since that tragic night, she has helped organize several interfaith initiatives in Montreal.“My goal was for people with different backgrounds and identities to participate in exchanges with Muslims to eliminate stereotypes,” Abou-Bakr said.From 2016 until last year, she headed MAC Give Montreal, a community organization encouraging young Muslims to volunteer and “become leaders of society through social engagement.” She has also collaborated with the English Montreal School Board to give talks to students about the negative effects of Islamophobia in society.Since 2019, she has worked with the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), currently serving as the Quebec Public Affairs Lead, engaging with government stakeholders as an advocate for better policy. She previously served as the NCCM’s Quebec Affairs Consultant and Quebec Advocacy Coordinator.Abou-Bakr says that her biggest accomplishment was leading the NCCM’s 2020 and 2021 national Green Square Campaigns, which encouraged people to wear a green square to commemorate the anniversary of the Quebec City mosque shooting. In 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the other federal party leaders were all seen wearing green squares. The Green Square Campaigns also raise money for the families of the victims, as well as to rebuild the CCIQ mosque, which had not been repaired since the 2017 tragedy.“I am humanizing who I am”Ehab Lotayef, the CCIQ Award fundraising campaign co-chair, says he’s known Abou-Bakr since she was in CEGEP, through their involvement in many intercultural events and activities. He says it was easy for him to endorse her for the award.“We felt that Sarah had worked audaciously to advance inclusion for awareness of Muslim students both at McGill and beyond, in a manner that deepened understanding of Muslim experiences, throughout showing tremendous energy, perseverance and intellect,” Lotayef said.Abou-Bakr says any contribution made toward the inclusion of the Muslim community and to fight Islamophobia can and will make an impact.“I like to believe that laws such as Bill 21 are clear proof that there needs to be more understanding and more inclusion,” she says.“I believe that one way to foster understanding is for our stories to be heard, and by telling mine, I am humanizing who I am, and humanizing people who look like me and share the same beliefs as me. That alone is an impact, because it makes people aware of the problems deeply embedded in our Canadian society that Muslims face every day because of lack of inclusion.”On Friday, Jan. 28 at 2:30 pm, McGill’s Associate Provost (Equity & Academic Policies), the Institute of Islamic Studies, and the Muslim Students Association will hold an online commemoration event for the victims of the Jan. 29, 2017, Quebec City Mosque shooting victims. This event is held in partnership with Muslim Awareness Week. The event is open to all members of the McGill community and also welcomes the participation of the general public.

McGill named one of the world’s most international universities,"McGill has a long-standing reputation as being one of the world’s most diverse institutions. That reputation was further solidified last week after McGill was named the 28th most international university in the world, and second in Canada, by Times Higher Education (THE).The THE list was compiled based on institutions’ international student score, international staff score, international co-authorship score and international reputation metrics collected for the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The World University Rankings analyses over 1,600 universities.Strength in diversityDiversity has always been one of McGill’s strengths. Traditionally, International students make up some 30 per cent of the University’s student body. This year, there are almost 12,000 international students enrolled at McGill, representing over 150 countries (see the table at the end of the article).“International students bring so much cultural and linguistic diversity to the campus, the classroom and student life. The Students’ Society of McGill University is home to over 80 student clubs that target international students,” says Pauline L’Ecuyer, Director of International Student Services (ISS) and The MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program. “Students are always fascinated to find so many other students from their home country at McGill.”ISS provides international students with a wide range of support that begins even before they arrive in Canada and, in some cases, years after they graduate.As early as March, ISS invites newly admitted students to attend a series of pre-arrival webinars covering immigration procedures; health insurance and access to healthcare in Quebec; and travel tips (now including vaccination requirements, travel restrictions, quarantine).Peer mentorshipISS also offers a pair of popular peer-mentor programs.The Buddy program – “probably the ancestor of peer-mentor programs at McGill,” says L’Ecuyer – matches International students with an upper year student with a similar profile (citizenship, language, Faculty, Graduate vs Undergraduate, etc.).In 2020, ISS introduced a new First Friend Program. The initiative began as a program to match new students studying remotely with another new student in the same time-zone.“This summer, the First Friend Program will match new international students from the same region to connect, before they even arrive at McGill,” says L’Ecuyer. “They goal of this new strategy is to help students relieve immigration stress or even make plans to travel to Montreal together so they have a friend at McGill, even before arriving in Montreal.”Orientation workshops, immigration supportOnce students arrive in Montreal, they have access to a series of ISS workshops to help them better understand and adapt to their new environment. Since 2020, Jos Porter, ISS Local Wellness Advisor, has been delivering a series of workshops on student wellness, mental health and navigating the health care system in Quebec.ISS also boasts a dedicated team of four licensed immigration specialists, who help students facing issues with their immigration documents (applying, renewing, supporting dependents, etc.)Finally, for the past five years, ISS has partnered with Université du Québec à Chicoutimi to offer the fully-funded McGill-Chicoutimi French Immigration Program to help international students transition to the work force either during or after their studies at McGill. Pre-pandemic, students would spend five weeks, living with a family in Saguenay, attending the Explore program and conducting industry site visits – completely in French. Since the onset of the pandemic, the program has been offered online but L’Ecuyer says the plan is to be back in-person this summer.Rounding out its extensive support, ISS offers an array of immigration programming, including Post-Graduation Work Permit, Working in Canada, and Renewing Immigration Documents. ISS also collaborates with the Quebec’s Ministry of Immigration, Francisation and Integration; and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to offer students information on how to apply for Permanent Residence.Adapting to the challenges of COVIDAt the onset of the COVID pandemic, ISS adapted rapidly in order to keep supporting their clients at that critical juncture. “We quickly turned to Zoom immigration appointments and remote workshops in the first year but we have been back on campus and offering hybrid services since August 2021,” says L’Ecuyer. “We have had to become very agile and quickly update our website with the latest information about entering and leaving Canada.L’Ecuyer credits her team’s creativity in keeping ISS programs running, offering online social activities such as trivia events; a Montreal scavenger hunt; and art programs with the McGill Wellness Hub for students with families. In December, ISS hosted a remote gingerbread house competition.“For many of our workshops, we noticed that the attendance was better attended virtually than in-person,” says L’Ecuyer. “So, we will definitely keep this hybrid model of delivery in the coming years.”Consult THE’s Most International Universities in the World rankings","Mon, 01/24/2022 - 16:46"
McGill ready to resume in-person teaching,"Earlier this month, Premier François Legault announced that Quebec universities could restart full in-person academic activities on Jan. 17. Starting Monday, Jan. 24, McGill will resume in-person classes for most teaching activities. To help the transition, instructors have the discretion to still teach up to 20 per cent of a course remotely, without additional authorization from their Chair or Director. Most lectures with more than 200 students will remain online.Professors Fabrice Labeau, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning), and Christopher Buddle, Associate Provost (Teaching and Academic Programs), spoke to the Reporter about what to expect from the return to in-person, accommodations, the many layers of protection McGill has in place for maintaining a safe environment and continuing the University’s commitment to in-person academics. The Quebec government allowed universities to resume their in-person activities starting Jan. 17. Why did McGill decide to wait an extra week?Christopher Buddle: We could have started back on the 17th, but we wanted instructors to have more time to prepare, and everyone a chance to get ready for the full return. In some disciplines, they’re very ready and want to go back to regular in-person classes on Monday, and in other areas, more of a progression is needed from a pedagogical point of view. Although there is advanced notice, it’s still very complicated to make that transition from online to in-person.What can we expect the week of Jan. 24 to look like?Fabrice Labeau: We expect in-person teaching and learning, and also research, to be happening progressively to make the transition smoother. With the 20 per cent discretion, we know many professors will be still teaching some courses online next week.Buddle: Obviously, we haven’t had anywhere near our “normal” numbers of people on campus this semester, but it’s important to remember that our campuses haven’t been empty either. Since the semester began on Jan. 3, between 6,000 and 10,000 people have been on McGill’s campuses every day for research, and for teaching and learning activities in the health sciences and music, among other disciplines. There has already been quite a bit of in-person activity.Labeau: And that really speaks to how successful the University has been in adhering to two main principles since the start of the pandemic: prioritizing the safety and well-being of our community, and staying true to our academic mission.I sent several MRO messages to the community last week, to help people get ready for next week. One of the things I emphasized was how safe Quebec’s universities have been throughout the Fall. Across Quebec, very few people caught the coronavirus through on-campus activities. At McGill during the Fall semester, there was no evidence that anyone caught the virus through contacts in a classroom—even though 85% of our teaching activities were in person. In the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) outbreak data for mid-December, for example, a period when there was a lot of in-person activity on Quebec campuses, and Omicron cases were beginning to rise sharply, outbreaks in Quebec universities only accounted for 0.1% of the outbreaks across Quebec.The University requires procedural masks to be worn indoors and doesn’t allow cloth masks unless they’re layered over a procedural. There’s a lot of talk right now about the efficacy of procedurals versus N95 masks. Can you talk about the differences?Labeau: There’s a lot of confusion out there about what literature to follow. I would advise everybody to look at a report issued recently by the INSPQ. It is a compilation of all the literature about the different masks.There’s no doubt that an N95 mask is better at isolating particles than a procedural mask, and a procedural mask is better than a cloth mask. And, of course, full-face respirators are better than N95 masks.But the question at the end of the day is what is the suitable protection for your particular setting? And that report, which is corroborated by medical experts, says that there are not many settings in a university environment that justify wearing an N95 mask.Wearing an N95 mask typically makes the most sense in a healthcare setting where people interact very closely with patients who have a very high likelihood of being positive. Those are not the conditions at a university. That’s not our level of risk.Speaking of interventions, how will the University ensure that people follow safety directives such as social distancing and wearing masks?Labeau: In the Fall, we had anywhere between 25,000 and 28,000 people on campus every day. We expect a similar load on our campus in the Winter term.In the Fall, we had security patrols and safety ambassadors who made us aware of “hotspots,” where we saw less adherence to directives; we increased the patrols in these areas. We’re going to go with something very similar for the Winter.This kind of presence leads to an overall environment with a very high degree of respect for the directives. Of course, it’s never 100 per cent, but that’s why we have the patrols.Can you talk more about the increased on-campus density, and how that will work for maintaining social distancing?Labeau: For now, we are limiting the presence of administrative and support staff to the people who directly support the activities that take place on campus or who cannot do their work from home. This will allow us to lower the density of administrative and support staff on campus compared to the end of the Fall.There are all sorts of possible configurations for administrative or support staff on campus but, typically, the directives regarding masking are the same. People have to wear masks all the time, even when they are seated and two meters away from somebody else. The only time someone can remove their mask is alone in an enclosed room or office.Because we aren’t calling back too many people to campus, it will greatly reduce the density in offices and administrative spaces. It’s going to make distancing a lot easier.In spaces like cafeterias, for instance, there are precise directives. At present, we can have six people per table and one meter between tables. That’s a reduction from the Fall when it was 10 people.What accommodations are in place for teaching staff who cannot teach 80 per cent of their courses in person?Labeau: It will depend on the reasons, of course. For immunocompromised individuals, we have the usual accommodations that were in place last semester. That, typically, would be the main reason for these kinds of accommodations.Buddle: Yes, there’s still a process to make sure that people who require the accommodations with respect to, for example, more chronic or long-term conditions – that’s available to them, as it has been since the start of the pandemic. In those cases, I’ll add that the types of accommodation also vary, depending on the teaching context and the Faculty. It’s not a one-size-fits-all, and I really don’t think it should be because it needs to be case-dependent and reflective of the sorts of accommodations that an individual might need.One of the things we always need to recognize at McGill is that there’s a lot of variation by Faculty, and for good reasons. Take clinical training in a hospital setting, for example. That won’t work remotely. The same is true for some of the performance areas in music. It was really important that Faculties were able to develop their own protocols that match their teaching and learning contexts. That’s why there are some differences across Faculties. The general principle is 20%, but some Faculties have adopted slightly different approaches.Can you talk about how the University is working to provide accommodations for students?Buddle: There are two parts to think about. One is the short-term absences because of students having COVID, or having to self-isolate. Those accommodations, in most cases, will be at the instructors’ discretion, and they’ll try to find a way to make sure a student doesn’t fall behind in a class. Last Fall, the evidence that we’ve heard from Faculties and the Dean of Students is that the process for short-term accommodations worked reasonably well. Instructors were very flexible in finding ways to support students that requested short-term absences. That process is still in place for this term. We’re strongly promoting the idea that all instructors record their materials, whenever they can, for the benefit of students needing a short-term accommodation.As for longer-term accommodations, it’s really a case-by-case approach because it has to match the individual issues that a student might bring forward. If there is a situation where a student requires support longer-term, then the Office of the Dean of Students will work with the Office for Students with Disabilities [OSD] to look at the individual case to see what can be reasonably put in place.The key part here is, what do we mean by “reasonable”? From the perspective of OSD, it really means accommodations that do not put in place undue hardship. But there might be some contexts where it’s simply not possible. For example, in certain kinds of training where hands-on competencies are necessary to complete the course, an accommodation just might not be possible. I would generally say, though, the Office of the Dean of Students certainly works hard on a case-by-case basis to find a strategy for students that need accommodations.Labeau: That’s a very good description of what we mean when we say “reasonable.” But I think the kinds of things we’re talking about are also accommodations that do not significantly change the way academic standards of a course are established. This is an extreme example, but if the request for accommodation is to not have exams in a course, we would say no to that. So, it’s very difficult to give you an answer that kind of covers every possible situation, because indeed, it’s on a case-by-case basis, and it depends on the course, on the method of evaluation, the types of conditions, and the length of the accommodation period.Buddle: I understand why this is a source of confusion for some students and why it isn’t easy to navigate for some students, because it is very complex. We have 40,000 students with so many different kinds of programs and different contexts for reaching the learning objectives that it’s really hard to have a one-size-fits-all, simple, straightforward process for those more complex accommodation needs.When it comes to deciding what entails a reasonable accommodation, how much autonomy does an instructor have?Labeau: The general principles are set by the University, and also the external rules we are subject to, and then the instructor is the person who is most knowledgeable about the material and the pedagogical aspect of the call. They know if a course was designed to be mainly in-person with a lot of group work, for instance, despite it not being a hands-on course. So having that kind of course be online, where a student can’t be in a group the whole semester, defeats the purpose of the whole pedagogical setup. That’s an instructor choice that may have a bearing on what can be done in terms of a reasonable accommodation.Some requests are not so simple, and we have people in the Dean of Students Office and the Office for Students with Disabilities who really work with the students and with the instructor to find a way to make the situation as normal as possible.You mentioned that short-term accommodations worked well in the Fall semester. Did other experiences from Fall help inform the planning for the return to in-person teaching this month?Labeau: Of course, today’s context is different from that of the Fall. We’re dealing with a different variant, a different impact in terms of being vaccinated or not, three doses versus two doses.But there are huge similarities in that we see a lot of anxiety about coming back. If you go back to the summer, just before the start of the Fall semester, we heard the same kind of anxiety around the idea of coming back, and that’s completely natural because we were basically starting our first semester that would be mostly in-person since the start of the pandemic. This time around, we’re trying to go back to in-person activity after going through a major wave of a new variant of the virus, with a lot more added restrictions in society. So naturally, a lot of anxiety is building up around this.The level of anxiety is still very high, but it’s important to remember that, last Fall, things settled down after a couple of weeks. When you look back, it was a very successful semester overall. It was way more successful than a lot of people anticipated before the semester.Last Fall, what was driving the management of the pandemic was the idea of making sure, as much as possible, that nobody would contract the virus. Now, the public health approach is more the idea that we all have to start living with the virus, and that there may be some contamination from time to time, but there will be a limited impact on individuals. I think that’s also the way we should all look at this as we restart in-person activity now. We will continue to keep those extra measures of care we put in place for the Fall in place this time around, to make sure we have all those layers of protection.I think some changes that will be very visible to members of our community point to the different way of managing the pandemic by the public health department here in Quebec. For instance, contact tracing used to be very detailed. But now, with Omicron being much more contagious, contact tracing is done by the individual who tests positive; they’re the ones who identify their significant contacts and tell them what to do.From a McGill perspective, we are still asking people to call our Case Management Group when someone tests positive, so we make sure they know exactly what the processes are.You might have also noticed that the isolation instructions have changed since the beginning of the pandemic. Back then, whenever you had to isolate because you tested positive, or if you were a significant contact of someone who tested positive, you had to isolate for 14 days. That became 10 days, and now, for a lot of people, it’s five days. That’s related to how we’re managing the pandemic, and what the impact of being positive means for individuals and for society in general. So, we’re basically adapting to all these different ways of dealing with a pandemic, but we still have layers of protection, most of all.Buddle: On the teaching side, an important change that we’ve seen over the course of the pandemic is providing the right kind of framework for decisions that are pedagogically sound – a change in terms of looking at how we can offer some increased flexibility for instructors who would like to do more blended learning, and also take into account some of the needs to be more flexible in the modality of delivery.I think we’re also seeing big trends in examinations. Compared to pre-pandemic, we reduced the number of final exam seats by a third in the Fall; I think we had about 40,000 exam seatings in the Fall versus 60,000 in 2019. I expect that trend will continue as well.I think there are some big shifts with respect to the teaching and learning that have happened through the Fall, and we’re continuing with those in the Winter term.Are teaching flexibility and decreasing exam seatings trends McGill might pursue permanently?Buddle: There are certain trends that are very positive from a teaching and learning perspective. But it’s not about the administration deciding. It’s about what makes sense from the teaching and learning perspective – which has to be done in partnerships with the Faculties and the instructors.What we’ve heard from instructors is a desire to have the right kinds of parameters and guidelines so that they can adapt their pedagogical approach in a way that makes sense across the University and also locally.Would the University consider making it mandatory for instructors to record all their lectures?Buddle: It’s not as simple as an on/off switch. There are some contexts where it’s just not possible to record things virtually.In a recent MRO, there were examples of when a virtual version of something is just not possible, and that’s not even the full extent of it. There are other kinds of teaching activities that can’t be easily captured online, as opposed to a large lecture that might have a very passive delivery for certain kinds of content. In the end, the quality of those teaching experiences is just not there if it’s done virtually.We’re not in a position to mandate recording, but we are absolutely in a position to strongly encourage it whenever possible, especially for those lectures that can be more easily captured online. We continue to work very closely with the Faculties to strongly encourage lecture recording, and we find in most cases that instructors are very happy to do that, especially in a lot of the larger classes. There’s a real recognition of the value of those recordings.Under what conditions could the Winter 2022 semester move back to mostly online?Labeau: Every decision we make is based on different factors. Of course, if provincial guidelines tell us we need to decrease the level of in-person activities, we will follow them.We know that higher education is a priority for the government, and keeping us in-person is important.That being said, we will have to look at that from the perspective of all our backup plans. As with our planning for the Fall semester, there are steps down from the level of activity that is nominal. We would resort to these steps if we need to do that.For example, starting Monday we will be working with no distancing in classrooms. However, if things were to go south, we can always go back to one-meter distancing in classrooms. Of course, this would mean fewer in-person classes. But we definitely don’t want to go there, unless it’s necessary.We will be monitoring the situation in the province, in Montreal, and at McGill to figure out what is necessary. Balancing the risks is not a trivial equation where you just look at a number and say “Going by that number, this is what we’ll do.” It’s a much more complex decision that takes into account predictions, the number of cases, number of hospitalizations, and the situation at McGill. It’s not a straightforward decision.Buddle: There are a variety of factors that change over time. The metrics that we relied on a year ago are very different than the metrics we use now.Labeau: Here’s an example. We set up a dashboard in the Fall that displayed a lot of different metrics to our community. People could follow the situation at McGill based on things such as how many cases we were tracing at McGill, and how many contacts we could identify. But we don’t have a good handle on these kinds of metrics anymore because of the testing situation in the province. There’s no centralized governmental way of getting tested and confirming a positive case anymore. Before, everybody had to get a PCR tests to be told if they were positive. In the Fall, we had the exact case count for McGill, just like public health had the exact count of positive people in the province. This is no longer the case.So we will continue reporting the number of cases, but it’s going to be an approximation. We’re still asking people to tell us if they tested positive, but they may or may not do it. So, we will be watching the trends. Are we getting more calls this week than the previous week, or is it going down?That will give us a sense of the trends at McGill, although we will never have access to the absolute number of cases.Our dashboard is evolving; some measurements have disappeared because they’re no longer meaningful. We will try to give more metrics that will indicate to our community where we stand.","Sat, 01/22/2022 - 21:56"

Masters student wins Centre culturel islamique de Québec Memorial Award,"Master’s student Sarah Abou-Bakr is this year’s recipient of the Centre culturel islamique de Québec (CCIQ) Memorial Award, for her efforts to promote awareness and understanding of the Muslim experience in Quebec and Canada.Each year, the CCIQ Memorial Award is awarded to a McGill student who shows commitment to fostering the inclusion of Muslims within the larger Quebecois and Canadian societies. The award was established in 2018, in memory of the six men who were murdered and the 19 others injured on Jan. 29, 2017, shortly after Sunday evening prayers at the Quebec City mosque.Deeply involvedAbou-Bakr says she learned quickly about anti-Muslim discrimination while growing up in Montreal, and from a young age, she’s been deeply involved in efforts to raise awareness about Muslim issues and speaking out against Islamophobia in the wider community. Currently, with McGill’s Institute for Islamic Studies, she’s preparing her master’s thesis on Islamophobia in Quebec over the last decade.Sarah Abou-Bakr is writing her master’s thesis on Islamophobia in Quebec over the last decadeDuring her undergraduate years, she worked at Concordia University’s legal information clinic. She also led the planning and organization of community consultations, events, and workshops specifically related to contemporary Muslim issues in Quebec, such as Bill 21 (the controversial secularism law), Bill 64 (which overhauls Quebec’s privacy laws), and the aftermath of the 2017 mosque shooting. Since that tragic night, she has helped organize several interfaith initiatives in Montreal.“My goal was for people with different backgrounds and identities to participate in exchanges with Muslims to eliminate stereotypes,” Abou-Bakr said.From 2016 until last year, she headed MAC Give Montreal, a community organization encouraging young Muslims to volunteer and “become leaders of society through social engagement.” She has also collaborated with the English Montreal School Board to give talks to students about the negative effects of Islamophobia in society.Since 2019, she has worked with the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), currently serving as the Quebec Public Affairs Lead, engaging with government stakeholders as an advocate for better policy. She previously served as the NCCM’s Quebec Affairs Consultant and Quebec Advocacy Coordinator.Abou-Bakr says that her biggest accomplishment was leading the NCCM’s 2020 and 2021 national Green Square Campaigns, which encouraged people to wear a green square to commemorate the anniversary of the Quebec City mosque shooting. In 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the other federal party leaders were all seen wearing green squares. The Green Square Campaigns also raise money for the families of the victims, as well as to rebuild the CCIQ mosque, which had not been repaired since the 2017 tragedy.“I am humanizing who I am”Ehab Lotayef, the CCIQ Award fundraising campaign co-chair, says he’s known Abou-Bakr since she was in CEGEP, through their involvement in many intercultural events and activities. He says it was easy for him to endorse her for the award.“We felt that Sarah had worked audaciously to advance inclusion for awareness of Muslim students both at McGill and beyond, in a manner that deepened understanding of Muslim experiences, throughout showing tremendous energy, perseverance and intellect,” Lotayef said.Abou-Bakr says any contribution made toward the inclusion of the Muslim community and to fight Islamophobia can and will make an impact.“I like to believe that laws such as Bill 21 are clear proof that there needs to be more understanding and more inclusion,” she says.“I believe that one way to foster understanding is for our stories to be heard, and by telling mine, I am humanizing who I am, and humanizing people who look like me and share the same beliefs as me. That alone is an impact, because it makes people aware of the problems deeply embedded in our Canadian society that Muslims face every day because of lack of inclusion.”On Friday, Jan. 28 at 2:30 pm, McGill’s Associate Provost (Equity & Academic Policies), the Institute of Islamic Studies, and the Muslim Students Association will hold an online commemoration event for the victims of the Jan. 29, 2017, Quebec City Mosque shooting victims. This event is held in partnership with Muslim Awareness Week. The event is open to all members of the McGill community and also welcomes the participation of the general public.

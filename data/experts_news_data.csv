Experts: COVID-19,10 May 2022,"Published: 10May2022  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      More than one in four Quebec adults developed COVID-19 antibodies between January and mid-March of this year, according to a study released by the province's blood services organization. The study by Héma-Québec, which was carried out at the request of the province's Health Ministry, used a test that was able to detect COVID-19 antibodies in adult blood donors. The organization concluded that 27.8 per cent of Quebec's adult population was infected with COVID-19 in the first 2½ months of the year. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue:  Featured expert - Immune response “The current COVID-19 pandemic underlines the importance of understanding the functioning of our bodies’ immune system. Critics of vaccines can now see how lethal a world without a vaccine can be. It also highlights the fact that in a globalized society the development and distribution of vaccines for all infectious diseases is an essential cornerstone of a stable society.”- Jörg Fritz, Associate Professor, Department of Microbiology & Immunology    Health Society Policy Economy Business Labour Research  Health Addictions | Children | Food security and nutrition | Immune system | Infectious diseases and viruses | Mental health | Physical activity and sports | Pregnancy | Safety | Telemedicine and eHealth Addictions Jeffrey Derevensky, James McGill Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology and Director, International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-risk Behaviours  ""During this period of quarantine when children and teenagers are left with a lot of unstructured time on their hands, it's especially challenging to limit their playing online internet games. Moderation is the key.""  Jeffrey Derevensky is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology and Director of the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-risk Behaviours. He is an international expert in the area of behavioural addictions and was on the World Health Organization's committee which helped identify Internet Gaming Disorder as a recognizable disorder. jeffrey.derevensky [at] mcgill.ca (English) Rachel Rabin, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “During these uncertain times, some people may use addictive substances to help cope with stress, anxiety and depression. While initially, it may appear that drugs are reducing these feelings, in fact, they can actually exacerbate them, leading people to increase their drug consumption. This can be especially worrisome for individuals who may be at increased risk of developing an addictive disorder or for those in recovery.”  Rachel Rabin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and a researcher at the Douglas Research Centre. Her research program focuses on developing a better understanding of the neurocognitive and social cognitive dysfunction in individuals with substance use disorders in both psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia) and non-psychiatric populations. rachel.rabin [at] mcgill.ca (English) Children Moshe Ben-Shoshan, Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics  “Given the rise of variants with elevated risk of contagion and associated with higher risk of severe disease, there is an increasing concern for unvaccinated children. We can expect to see an increase of children being confined to their homes which has been shown to have negative psychological impacts such as depression and anxiety. Vaccination of all individuals including children is crucial in order to protect all Canadians and return to normality.”  Moshe Ben Shoshan is an Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics and pediatric allergy and immunology specialist at the Montreal’s Children Hospital. His research looks at the prevalence and potential determinants of food allergies and anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) in children. moshe.ben-shoshan [at] mcgill.ca (English) Joanna Merckx, Affiliated Member, Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health  ""Epidemiologic research on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires diagnostic technologies and the capacity to interpret results of clinical and population tests for active infection, disease and for history of exposure. Infection and disease affect different populations differently, and age is one of the most important dimensions that impacts all aspects of epidemic spread and health consequences. The particular case of children is an especially understudied clinical and public health problem that as a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases I have a special commitment to research and understand.”  Joanna Merckx is an Affiliated Member in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health and the Director of Medical Affairs at bioMérieux Canada, Inc., where she studies the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Her work focuses on clinical infectiology and epidemiology of infectious diseases with an emphasis on diagnostics, pediatrics and perinatology. joanna-trees.merckx [at] mcgill.ca (Dutch, English, French, Spanish) Jesse Papenburg, Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics  ""At the beginning of the pandemic, it was suggested that young children were less likely to become infected and this statement still holds true. That being said, because children tend to be asymptomatic or even asymptomatic and suffer from mild illness, there may also be many infected children who have gone undetected and missed us. However, data confirms that the proportion of infected children who need to go to the emergency department and be hospitalized is much lower than in adults and the overall severity of the disease is much lower in children.”  Jesse Papenburg is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics and an Infectious Disease specialist and medical microbiologist at the Montreal Children’s Hospital.

Some people report more time for home cooking and improving their diet. Many others have a poor diet due to limited resources, cooking skills, and access to fresh foods, or due to periods of anxiety, depression and isolation. We need high-quality data to document how eating behaviours and food intake are affected and by which determinants, as these may have long-term consequences on health outcomes.""  Stéphanie Chevalier is an Associate Professor in the School of Human Nutrition and an Associate Member of the Department of Medicine. Her research studies the processes that lead to the loss of muscle mass and strength with aging, and other conditions such as cancer, viral pandemics and diabetes, that may interfere with normal functioning. Her latest initiative, the COVIDiet survey, aims to understand how the eating habits of Canadians are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. stephanie.chevalier [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Daiva Nielsen, Assistant Professor, School of Human Nutrition  “Little information is currently available to help us understand how Quebecers organized themselves around getting food during the strict closures and how this experience might have been similar or different in various regions, while being mindful of economic factors that play a role in shaping challenges. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be a societal issue for some time to come, this data will be valuable to inform food access strategies to help us prepare in the event of future outbreaks.”  Daiva Nielsen is an Assistant Professor in the School of Human Nutrition. She is currently leading a study to compare household food procurement experiences across different regions in Quebec, including those more affected by COVID-19. daiva.nielsen [at] mcgill.ca (English) Anne-Julie Tessier, PhD candidate, School of Human Nutrition  ""Diet ranks as the second leading risk factor for chronic diseases including cardiovascular, diabetes, chronic kidney diseases and cancer in Canada, smoking ranking first. It is unclear how food intake, eating habits and other lifestyle behaviours have changed and will continue to be impacted as the pandemic progresses. Using an artificial intelligence-enhanced food tracker app, Canadians are capturing their eating in a fun and easy way. Our goal is to understand which factors such as stress, food access, working from home, possibly modify diet and whether it is linked to the incidence of chronic diseases.""  Anne-Julie Tessier is a registered dietitian and a PhD candidate in the School of Human Nutrition.

Gerald Batist is a Full Professor in the Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology and the Director of the McGill Centre for Translational Research in Cancer and the Segal Cancer Centre at the Jewish General Hospital. His research programs are in novel therapeutics, and he’s made significant contributions to the development of new cancer treatments. gerald.batist [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Judith Mandl, Assistant Professor, Department of Physiology  “Bat species have been implicated as the reservoir hosts of numerous zoonotic viruses, including Ebola, Marburg, Hendra, Nipah, rabies and coronaviruses. The immune responses of bats to these viruses results in very different infection outcomes compared to humans (e.g. no obvious clinical signs of infection in bats as opposed to sometimes very high lethality in humans, depending on the virus in question). Understanding how and why the immune response differs from animals to humans could provide us with better tools to prevent disease in humans when a new virus crosses over from its wild animal reservoir.”  Judith Mandl is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physiology and holds the Canada Research Chair in Immune Cell Dynamics. Her research has made important contributions to the field of HIV pathogenesis, demonstrating the absence of ongoing type I interferon production in a natural host for SIV and its impact on downstream adaptive responses. Her current work focuses on T cell recirculation in mouse models of infection or immunodeficiency, making use of cutting-edge research tools that allow linking individual cell-level to population-level processes, including intravital 2-photon and confocal microscopy. judith.mandl [at] mcgill.ca (English) Giorgia Sulis, Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health  “COVID-19 likely had a significant impact on health-seeking behaviours and health risk perceptions among older adults. Older adults are at higher risk of serious illness from the virus that causes COVID-19 and the influenza virus. Interestingly, our research shows that, compared to those who did not report having flu shots prior to the pandemic, individuals with a prior history of influenza vaccination were both significantly more likely to receive a flu shot in the 2020/21 season and to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Factors related to the pandemic, such as being concerned about COVID-19, also played in role in determining flu vaccine uptake in this population.”  Giorgia Sulis is an infectious disease epidemiologist and Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health. Her research interests encompass various global health areas, and primarily tuberculosis, antibiotic usage and vaccines, with a particular focus on low and middle-income countries. In a recent study published in the journal Vaccine, she examined flu vaccine uptake and willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine from approximately 23,000 participants enrolled in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, a national platform for research on aging. giorgia.sulis [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English, Italian) Marc Tewfik, Associate Professor, Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery  ""COVID-19 has raised public awareness of the importance of the sense of smell: affected individuals that lose their ability to smell quickly realize that it is a key part of many of our daily pleasures, such as enjoying good food. Perhaps more importantly though, it is an important mechanism for keeping us safe from harm.""  Marc Tewfik is an Associate Professor in the Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery and Director of the Advanced Rhinology and Endoscopic Skull Base Fellowship program.

Vaccines are now available with excellent protection and few side-effects. Additional vaccines will be available soon and the priority is to vaccinate the entire world to protect the population and decrease the chances of the emergence of new variants. While specific monoclonal antibodies have been developed against the virus, their widespread utilization is limited. Specific new treatments are necessary, and their search is ongoing.""  Anne Gatignol is Full Professor in the Department of Medicine and an Associate Member of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. She teaches virology and viral pathogenesis, including emerging viruses. Her research focus is currently on the development of RNA-based treatments against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and SARS-CoV-2. anne.gatignol [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)  Qian (Vivian) Liu, Assistant Professor, Institute of Parasitology  “Spike proteins of the emerging variants are superior at infection, even in the presence of antibodies generated by patients and vaccinated people. In our new study, by observing the behaviors of the spike protein and its receptors on a single-molecule level we expect to learn why this is the case, and to generate high-quality scientific data to accelerate the development of new prevention and treatment strategies to curb the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.”  Qian (Vivian) Liu is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Parasitology and a Full Member of the McGill Centre for Viral Diseases. Her research focuses on understanding the virus-host interactions during the infection and transmission of emerging zoonotic viruses (such as SARS-CoV-2). qian.liu3 [at] mcgill.ca (English, Mandarin) Matthew Oughton, Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases  “As the majority of the population presumably remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, relaxing mitigation measures that have been in place for months necessarily come with some risk. Those risks are manageable, provided that adequate testing and contact tracing continue to be performed and need to be balanced against the many regular activities that our population requires in order to function effectively.”  Matthew Oughton is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine and a specialist in infectious diseases and medical microbiology. He is based at the Jewish General Hospital, where he supervises the bacteriology and molecular microbiology laboratories. His research interests are focused on the use of molecular techniques to improve clinical diagnostic assays, with relevant publications on C. difficile, MRSA, influenza, and other pathogens. matthew.oughton [at] mcgill.ca (English) Raymond Tellier, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases  ""The current episode, involving a virus jumping from another animal species to humans, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is a classic episode of an ‘emerging virus’. We should note that since SARS, there have been other instances involving coronaviruses, such as the MERS in the Middle East, SADS (a disease affecting swine) in China and now the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19.”  Raymond Tellier recently joined the Infectious Diseases team at the McGill University Health Centre and was previously at the University of Calgary, where he remains an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. He was part of the research team who first identified the SARS associated coronavirus in Toronto following the outbreak in 2003, in collaboration with several groups in Toronto, Hamilton and Vancouver. raymond.tellier [at] muhc.mcgill.ca (English, French) Donald Vinh, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases  “Recent research shows that curfews have proven to be among some of the most effective interventions, when used with other lockdown measures, to combat COVID-19 because of the age demographic they target and the message they send.”  Donald Vinh is an Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and is an Associate Member in the Departments of Human Genetics and Experimental Medicine.

He holds the Canada CIFAR AI Chair and is involved with the Mila Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. His latest scholarly work explores the wide-ranging, negative consequences that social isolation has on our psychological well-being and physical health, including decreased life span. danilo.bzdok [at] mcgill.ca (English, French, German, Italian) Patricia Dobkin, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine  “Physician resilience can be an antidote to burnout and distress. It can be fostered through both ‘bottom up’ measures, such as physicians finding meaning in their work and being able to embody mindfulness, and ‘top down’ approaches, such as directors showing appreciation and providing support (e.g. PPE) for physicians. COVID-19 is challenging due to its uncertainty, unpredictability and various unknowns. Working together, taking care of ourselves, and maintaining realistic hope will help us all get through these turbulent times.”  Patricia Dobkin is a clinical psychologist and an Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine. She is affiliated with the McGill Programs in Whole Person Care, where she offers doctors and allied health care professionals Mindfulness-Based Medical Practice workshops and courses. Her research focuses on physician well-being and improving patient care.patricia.dobkin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Joe Flanders, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology  “Heading into this fall, we were hoping the COVID-19 pandemic was in the rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, a small but steady stream of cases, primarily among children and unvaccinated adults, reminds us that the threat is still out there and that we have to, somehow, continue to be vigilant. Public debates about the merit of public health restrictions have added to our collective tension. And yet, the scientific evidence could not be any clearer and our confidence more justified. We were spared the worst of the Delta variant wave because of a successful vaccination campaign and now vaccines for our younger children and boosters for the rest of us will further accelerate our momentum toward normalcy.”  Joe Flanders is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and the founder and director of the MindSpace Clinic, a Montreal-based full-service clinic promoting well-being in individuals, organizations, and communities. He offers Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy to individuals, groups, and organizations. joe.flanders [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Reut Gruber, Full Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “During the COVID-19 pandemic it is especially important for everyone to establish and follow good sleep habits so they get healthy sleep. Stressors that contribute to insomnia are amplified during the pandemic due to lifestyle changes, and thoughts and feelings that make people worry or feel anxious at night. People suffering from insomnia can seek the help of licensed psychologists with expertise in behavioural interventions for sleep disorders. It is important to note that certifications from institutes or organizations that are not part of a professional society (such as sleep ‘coaches’ or ‘consultants’ ) are usually not regulated and are not licensed or trained in behavioural sleep medicine.”  Reut Gruber is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Director of the Attention, Behaviour and Sleep Laboratory at the Douglas Research Centre. Her research focuses on three themes as they relate to pediatric sleep: ADHD, academic performance, and mental health. reut.gruber [at] mcgill.ca (English) Jason Harley, Assistant Professor, Department of Surgery  “Anxiety isn’t the only emotion that can negatively impact the quality of our thinking and responsible behavior. As numbers continue to improve in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, we must also be vigilant of the influence that relief can have in directing our attention and influencing the way we make sense of COVID-19-related information. Like most things, relief is good in the right dosage because too much can lead to overconfidence, selectively attending to pandemic-related information, and adopting behaviors before they are advised for our and others’ safety.”  Jason Harley is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Surgery, an Associate Member of the Institute for Health Sciences Education and a Junior Scientist at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC). They are currently conducting research to investigate coping strategies health care workers are using to deal with stress during the pandemic, assess their effectiveness and use that information to recommend new measures to protect the mental health of health care professionals. In collaboration with the SAILS Lab, they are also a developing and testing public education tools to enhance COVID-19 health and media literacy with a special focus on the role of emotion regulation in promoting public understanding and adaptive health behaviors. jason.harley [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Ross Otto, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology  ""While the pandemic restrictions have been rather strict and have limited many activities, we should still expect to see person-to-person variability in the ways we perceive the riskiness of less restricted activities, and consequently, the extent to which we engage in these activities – for example, taking a vacation overseas or going to a friend's house for dinner.""  Ross Otto is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology. He studies human decision-making and more recently has been focusing on the impact of pandemic- related fear and/or anxiety on cognitive function and risk-taking. ross.otto [at] mcgill.ca (English) Soham Rej, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry   “Issues related to mental health affect more than a million older adults in Canada, costing nearly $15 billion annually. This situation has been amplified by the pandemic and could continue to worsen in the post-COVID-19 world. Many initiatives, such as a large-scale volunteer-based telemedicine program Telehealth and other technology initiatives (VR, Zoom, platforms, robotics, etc.) launched by our team, will help address this growing problem.”  Soham Rej is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and a geriatric psychiatrist at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH). He is currently leading a team of researchers who is running the large-scale Volunteer-Based Telehealth Intervention Program to over a thousand isolated older adults (TIP-OA) in Montreal and examines clinical trials in late-life mood, anxiety, and cognitive disorders at the JGH Geri-PARTy Lab and McGill Meditation and Mind-body Medicine Research Clinic (MMMM-RC). soham.rej [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Brett Thombs, Full Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “No one could have imagined how the COVID-19 pandemic would affect mental health. Our team has reviewed over 40,000 studies as part of our living systematic review of mental health in COVID-19, which provides a better understanding of how much people have been affected, who has been affected, and what has happened to mental health across different periods of the pandemic.”   Brett Thombs is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and an Associate Member of the Departments of Educational & Counselling Psychology; Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, Medicine, Psychology; and the Biomedical Ethics Unit. He is conducting (1) a large-scale, worldwide study on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 and mitigation efforts like social distancing, particularly on people already suffering from chronic medical conditions and (2) a trial of an intervention designed to reduce negative mental health effects.  brett.thombs [at] mcgill.ca (English) Samuel Veissière, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Co-director, Culture, Mind and Brain Program  “In times of great uncertainty, catastrophes or disruptions of the social order, people often look for simple narratives and explanatory models to identify culprits. Conspiracy theories can become viral in such moments because they are catchy and intuitive, easy to remember, and easy to pass on. All conspiracy theories follow a similar intuitive recipe grounded in fear of pollution and desire to protect the purity of perceived victims. At a time when the need to work together to build a healthier world has never been so apparent, it is time to treat the Internet for what it is: the most alarming public health risk and threat to democracy we have ever known.”  Samuel Veissière is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, the Co-director of the Culture, Mind, and Brain program and an Associate Member of the Department of Anthropology. An interdisciplinary anthropologist and cognitive scientist, he studies social dimensions of cognition, consciousness, and human well-being through a variety of projects including placebo effects and hypnosis, hyper-sociality in smartphone addiction, social polarization, gender and mental health, and the theoretical study of cultural evolution. samuel.veissiere [at] mcgill.ca (English, French, Portuguese) Anna Weinberg, Associate Professor, Department of Psychology  “Stress is a risk factor for a huge range of health problems, including increases in anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 pandemic has many elements that make it a particularly potent stressor—including its chronicity, its ability to erode sources of comfort, like social support, and the sustained uncertainty that it has injected into so many areas of our lives. We are already seeing heightened symptoms of anxiety and depression around the world, and these effects may increase over time as the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt. However, not everyone is experiencing the pandemic in the same way, and different individuals are differentially susceptible to the effects of stress. It is critical to address both the unequal distribution of pandemic-related stress and to promote strategies that individuals can use to buffer against the adverse effects of stress.”  Anna Weinberg is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology. She holds the Canada Research Chair in Clinical Neuroscience. Her research focuses on identifying biological pathways that give rise to disordered emotional experience. anna.weinberg [at] mcgill.ca (English) Robert Whitley, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “COVID-19 restrictions have caused separation from the people, places, and social activities that give our life purpose and meaning. That said, it is important to note that there is a crucial difference between being alone and being lonely. For some, being alone represents a desirable time of comfort and solace. Indeed, such solitude can inspire renewal through reflection and introspection, and can also give time for meaningful activities including meditation, prayer, exercise, writing, creative arts and other activities which can foster positive mental health.”  Robert Whitley is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Principal Investigator of the Social Psychiatry Research and Interest Group (SPRING) at the Douglas Research Centre. He conducts research on various areas of social psychiatry including religion/spirituality and mental health, psychosocial recovery from mental illness and men’s mental health. robert.whitley [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Physical activity and sports  Steven Grover, Full Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine  “During social isolation, engaging Canadians to maintain healthy lifestyle habits is at least as important as avoiding the infection. Given that approximately 2/3 of Canadians are overweight or obese and only 15% meet current physical activity guidelines, the impact of more sedentary behaviour, weight gain, and increased stress will result in a huge jump in cases of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and mental health problems including insomnia, anxiety and depression. How we manage our physical and mental health during social isolation is critical and at least as important as maintaining the isolation itself.”  Steven Grover is a Full Professor in the Department of Medicine and a Senior Scientist at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.

For instance, many people have the common goal of doing exercise three times a week, though now gyms and sport fields are no longer accessible to the public. Due to the current situation, some have instead taken up jogging, outdoor calisthenics or even invented their own parkour circuits. Such creative adaptations not only allow us to get exercise but also leads us to a new activity that can be surprisingly rewarding.”  Richard Koestner is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychology and the head of the McGill Human Motivation Lab.

When you combine maternal stress with the environmental adversity from the COVID-19 crisis, you have the potential for greater mental health challenges for children who are born into this post-pandemic world. Mental health ought to be a fundamental part of prenatal health. We need to appreciate the importance of mental health needs across the lifespan, starting with pregnancy.”  Ashley Wazana is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and a clinician-scientist at the Jewish General Hospital.

Both non-recirculating and recirculating air filtration systems are recommended by the WHO. Air filters are certified to meet stringent standards. The efficiency of filtration of certified filters is known and corresponds to the standard a given filter meets. SARS-CoV-2 virions are found across a wide range of aerosol particle sizes. Filters are certified for efficiency of filtration at the most penetrating particle size.”  Yevgen Nazarenko is a Research Associate in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.

When implementing prevention strategies, multiple facets have to be taken into consideration such as physical space, administrative processes and human behaviors. Our last line of defense is often protective equipment like masks, gloves and ocular protection, but this is the ‘weakest’ line of defense. Each population or group needs a tailored approach, and an approach that specifically involves the members of the group involved; an approach of which they can take ownership.”  Leighanne Parkes is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine and an infectious disease specialist and microbiologist at the Jewish General Hospital. She is currently collaborating in a McGill-led clinical research initiative to test the efficacy of existing drugs against COVID-19, in the hopes they may improve outcomes as a vaccine is being developed. leighanne.parkes [at] mcgill.ca (English) Vincent Poirier, Assistant Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine   “When traveling, in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a real risk, which may be minimized by combining several mitigation strategies.

Places where the risk is particularly high include public transport, workplaces and enclosed environments that are experiencing increased traffic as we lighten ‘lockdown’ restrictions. We should continue to emphasize the attitude that ‘I protect you, you protect me, together we protect society’ embodied in personal practices that include hand washing and good hygiene, staying at home when possible, isolating when ill, general awareness of contact precautions, especially around vulnerable people or groups, and the practice of physical distancing and physical barriers such as masks.”  Avinash Sinha is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesia and an anesthesiologist at the McGill University Health Centre.

To overcome this problem, we use telerehabilitation to deliver customized and personalized at-home therapy sessions while adhering to physical distancing guidelines. We are interested in exploring the impact of the pandemic on the delivery rehabilitation services. To do so, we are performing a retrospective analysis of the files of post-stroke users admitted to a COVID-19 designated rehabilitation centre since March 2020.

Since there are not that many people living in chronic homelessness – likely fewer than 3,000 in Montreal – we could, in time, work towards ensuring that everyone has a decent place to live. The cost of doing so would be modest in relation to the benefits – less than $10,000 per year once savings in shelters, emergency department visits, etc. are taken into account. This would enable a person to have an apartment of their own and a professional support team to help them stay housed and move on with their lives.

Asian Canadians have been unfairly and erroneously scapegoated for the spread of COVID-19. Far-right groups use uncertain times such as these to promote and propagate their hatred and bigotry, using Asian Canadians as stand-ins for their displeasure with Canada’s migratory policies and with globalization more generally. Given recent violence in the U.S. and Canada, there is little indication that anti-Asian sentiment or behaviour will decline with the end of the pandemic.

There is currently a need to improve the capacity of Indigenous communities to wisely navigate the trade-offs implicit in large-scale public health measures---for instance, whether the benefit of mandatory lockdowns justifies the risk of increased domestic violence and harm to mental health. Indigenous communities often have a substantially higher proportion of multi-generational households, as well as larger household sizes and more crowding in households than the Canadian average. If contact patterns in Indigenous communities differ substantially from those incorporated into conventional predictive epidemiological models, there is a risk that their predictions become inaccurate enough to do more harm than good if used to design public health interventions for such communities.”  Pauley Tedoff is a PhD candidate and a Vanier Scholar in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health and a researcher at the Margaret A.

At the moment, it is a crisis that requires immediate solutions, but this is an issue than runs much deeper and has been building for decades. What we are now forced to face is a larger systemic issue that impacts stigmatized populations, such as seniors and those living with mental illness. As a society we have continuously turned a blind eye to these populations and, as a result, medical specialties such as geriatrics and psychiatry have been grossly underfunded and lack the support needed to properly care for some of our most vulnerable citizens.”  Susan Mintzberg is a PhD Candidate in the School of Social Work.

This risk is due to aging effects on the immune system, but also chronic diseases, poor level of physical function, malnutrition and medications. Those who have mobility and cognitive issues do worse because of difficulty coping with hygiene and distancing measures. The physical distancing will have more detrimental effects of older adults with dementia as they don’t understand what is going on and suffer from lack of social contact At this stage of the pandemic, it is time to look at the collateral effects of lack of services and socialization to those who are home bound (a much greater number of elderly than those in CHSLDs).”  José Morais is a Full Professor in the Department of Medicine and the Director of the Division of Geriatric Medicine.

Family members play a key role in supporting care in CHSLDs, so the fact they have been deemed as 'non-essential' is problematic. Additionally, more and more people are dealing with the death of loved ones and may not have adequate advance care planning measures in place to handle such situations. In the context of COVID-19, conversations about death are even more pressing.

They are not only at risk for infection, but also suffer greatly from the population-level containment strategies – such as social distancing – and disrupted access to supportive and health care. Eighty per cent of the deaths during the pandemic have taken place in long-term care in Canada, and we know that approximately 80 per cent of people in long-term care have dementia.

Not only are women more likely to be in frontline professions such as nursing, teaching, and the service industry, but they are also more likely to be primary caregivers for children who cannot yet be vaccinated. While reports of domestic violence increased during the lockdown stages of the pandemic, the challenges of protecting families as society opens again may put women at a further disadvantage. It is imperative that provincial and federal governments ensure that all marginalized communities, and especially the women in these communities, have access to the supports and resources they need to keep themselves, their children, and families safe.”  Shaheen Shariff is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education and an Associate Member of the Faculty of Law.

Understanding and preparing for these changes will be critical for a retail industry that was already well attuned to rapid and evolving transformation.”  Maxime Cohen is a Full Professor of Retail Management and Operations Management at the Desautels Faculty of Management and the Co-Director of the McGill Retail Innovation Lab. His core expertise lies at the intersection of data science and operations management. maxime.cohen [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Yu Ma, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “The retail industry has to be prepared for the multifaceted and profound impact of the pandemic. The pandemic has changed consumer purchasing habits in many ways. Consumers are buying more online, experiencing more anxiety in brick-and-mortar stores, and are feeling the higher cost of living in their daily lives. Retailers have to adapt these changes quickly to survive.”  Yu Ma is an Associate Professor in the Desautels Faculty of Management and a Bensadoun Faculty Scholar. His research interest includes food marketing, retailing and big data analytics. Using consumer purchase data and advanced econometric and statistical models, he studies how consumers react to various marketing incentives. yu.ma [at] mcgill.ca (English) Ashesh Mukherjee, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “The Internet has made other people’s panic buying much more visible. Online news from around the world highlights shortages of products; the moment we access such content in our Facebook feed, we are automatically shown similar stories in future news feeds. This creates an illusion that everyone is hoarding, which prompts us to do the same. Hoarding is a self-fulfilling prophecy: people who hear about possible shortages buy more, which causes merchandise to disappear from shelves and makes the shortage seem real.”  Ashesh Mukherjee is an Associate Professor of Marketing at the Desautels Faculty of Management, where he teaches consumer behavior and marketing management. His research focuses on marketing communications, word-of-mouth, online behaviour and pro-social behaviour, including the use of scarcity in advertising, the impact of product advisors on consumer decision-making and behavior in peer-to-peer markets such as Airbnb and Uber. ashesh.mukherjee [at] mcgill.ca (English) Javad Nasiry, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “The sudden spike in demand, whether for medical supplies or consumer goods, has caught supply chain managers by surprise. Supply chains are resilient enough to weather the short-term consequences and catch up with demand. However, labour markets that are affected by sickness, strikes, and layoffs can jeopardize the short-term and, more critically, the long-term response to the COVID-19 crisis.”  Javad Nasiry is an Associate Professor of Operations Management at the Desautels Faculty of Management. His main research interests are in behavioral operations, supply chain management, retail operations, operations-marketing interface, and empirical operations-finance interface. His work in behavioral operations elaborates on whether and how psychological phenomena such as reference effects may affect aggregate variables (e.g., market demand) and their implications on firms' operational policies especially in pricing, inventory, and assortment. javad.nasiry [at] mcgill.ca (English) Saibal Ray, James McGill Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management and Academic Director, Bensadoun School of Retail Management  “Supply chain problems and their impact have taken over the news cycle as the ‘pandemic news’ wanes. However, it is important to understand the underlying reason for this phenomenon, what are the short-medium term implications and what are the long-term solutions (if any). Especially important is to think about the pros and cons of shorter and perhaps local supply chains and how companies can manage supply chain associated risks.”  Saibal Ray is a James McGill Professor of Operations Management at the Desautels Faculty of Management and the Academic Director of the Bensadoun School of Retail Management. His expertise is in supply chain management, specifically supply chain risk management, retail operations management, and supply chain issues related to agri-food and natural resources sectors. saibal.ray [at] mcgill.ca (English) Telework and remote work   Marie-Lyne Grenier, Faculty Lecturer, School of Physical & Occupational Therapy  “Globally, many workers and students are adapting to the shift to working and learning from home. This shift comes with particular risks to one’s physical and mental health. Ensuring an ergonomic working or learning space can decrease the risk for physical and mental health difficulties. Resources to help guide workers and students are abundant online. However, sifting through these resources to determine evidence-based ‘best practices’ is much more challenging and yet vital to preventing further risks to workers’ physical and mental health. Tips for how to set-up an ergonomic space that is based on sound evidence should be prioritized for at-home workers and learners to decrease health risks during this period of social distancing.”  Marie-Lyne Grenier is an Occupational Therapist and Faculty Lecturer at the School of Physical & Occupational Therapy. She is also an ergonomic specialist and a consultant. marie-lyne.grenier [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Jean-Nicolas Reyt, Assistant Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “For millions of Canadians, hybrid work is the new normal. Managers who have no experience with remote workers face important challenges, such as monitoring performance, maintaining employee motivation, and onboarding new team members. Organizations need to redefine what ""management"" means in a world where employees work remotely.”  Jean-Nicolas Reyt is an Assistant Professor at the Desautels Faculty of Management, where he teaches organizational behavior and negotiation.

New work is being created and some existing work is being destroyed. Many of these changes could persist well beyond the pandemic itself.”  Lisa Cohen is an Associate Professor and Director of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion at the Desautels Faculty of Management. Prior to joining Desautels, she was a faculty member at the London Business School, the Yale School of Management and the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, where she taught in the areas of strategic human resources, organizational behavior, and communications. lisa.cohen2 [at] mcgill.ca (English) Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “Two years into the pandemic, the inequalities it exposed remain stark. Initial sympathies for ‘essential workers’ did not translate into increased concern for their health and safety, and many temporary measures like ‘hero pay’ have been walked back. Women have borne the brunt of increased unpaid care work as schools and daycares remained closed or moved online. Meanwhile, essential workers, those with disabilities, and communities of colour have been the most impacted by the virus, as they are those most economically insecure, and therefore least able to take steps to stay safe. The government response in Canada, while favorable compared to the policy and public health disaster that has unfolded in the U.S., has still failed to address these inequalities. Addressing the fundamental social power imbalance is key to bringing the pandemic under control and protecting everyone.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology. As a comparative historical sociologist, his research explores the changing relationship between social mobilization, political processes, and ideology in advanced capitalist democracies. barry.eidlin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) John-Paul Ferguson, Assistant Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “The restrictions on economic activity that we have to observe to fight this virus will land disproportionately on those people more marginally employed. The way we try to remedy that — specifically the forms economic stimulus can take — will have to look different than what was employed, for example, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis in the United States. In the end, subsidies to employers are likely to leave contract workers out in the cold.”  John-Paul Ferguson is an Assistant Professor of Organizational Behaviour in the Desautels Faculty of Management. His research focuses on careers, labor markets, and employment segregation.

The second approach is to have the government subsidizing wages in order to avoid layoffs. As for Canada, the new Emergency Response Benefit (ERB) is in line with the first approach. The 75% wage subsidy for small and medium businesses belongs to the second approach. There are pros and cons to each of these measures.”  Francesco Amodio is an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics and the Institute for the Study of International Development. His research focuses on labour economics, development economics, and political economy.

Whether or not the tragedies of COVID-19 within the agricultural sector and temporary foreign worker program will spark meaningful political change very much remains to be seen.”  Edward Dunsworth is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies, where he teaches courses in Canadian history, with an emphasis on migration, labour, and Canada in the world. His forthcoming book, Harvesting Labour: Tobacco and the Global Making of Canada’s Agricultural Workforce, uses a case study of tobacco farm labour in 20th century Ontario to examine the histories of farm labour and temporary foreign worker programs in Canada. edward.dunsworth [at] mcgill.ca (English, Spanish) Jill Hanley, Associate Professor, School of Social Work  “It is a critical question of both human rights and public health that migrant workers in Canada get access to all the same services and supports as other workers at this time. They need free access to healthcare, regardless of their status, and they need access to the income security measures that will allow them to self-isolate if necessary or to make ends meet if they lose their jobs in the economic downturn. These measures are important for the workers themselves, for their families who rely on their income, and for public health in general.”  Jill Hanley is an Associate Professor at the School of Social Work and the Scientific Director of the Sherpa Research Institute on Migration, Health and Social Services. Her work focuses on closing the gaps between policies and practice concerning the social rights of migrant populations. jill.hanley [at] mcgill.ca (English, French, Spanish) Nonstandard work Chantal Westgate, Senior Faculty Lecturer, Desautels Faculty of Management  “For many people the gig economy is just an opportunity to make extra money. But according to studies, the gig economy is the primary source of income for one third of its workers. There are impacts, both mental and physical, resulting from being involved in the gig economy that range from underemployment , to a lack of control over one’s hours, to stress from working more than one job, and reduced well-being due to the uncertainties of working in this sector.”  Chantal Westgate teaches a variety of organizational behavior courses at the undergraduate, graduate, continuing education, and executive training levels.

As the only hierarchy in science are results that stand the test of time and those that don’t, cross-fertilization of ideas between epidemiologists, immunologists, virologists, geneticists and many other research disciplines is critical in order to develop a roadmap to that exit.”  Maziar Divangahi is a Professor of Medicine and Strauss Chair in Respiratory Diseases in the Department of Medicine and Associate Director of the Program for Translational Research in Respiratory Diseases at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC). He is an internationally recognized pulmonary immunologist and the overarching focus of his research program is to investigate the regulatory mechanisms involved in innate and adaptive immunity against two major pulmonary pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza virus (H1N1), and to understand the critical differences between protective and deleterious immune responses. maziar.divangahi [at] mcgill.ca (English) Richard Gold, James McGill Professor, Faculty of Law  “Since the pandemic hit two years ago, researchers in government and private labs have accomplished seeming miracles: the development of highly-performing vaccines, an antiviral, and other treatments. It was public funding in various forms – research grants, direct funding, advance purchase orders, etc. – that drove these advances rather than the traditional intellectual property system. Despite this, firms exercised control over the vaccines and drugs in such a way that lower-income countries have not had access to them. Instead, they are forced to try to develop their own vaccines based on public knowledge, delaying access for years. Canada has had to pay billions for vaccines but still has no security of supply for when the next pandemic or health crisis hits. Yet, Canadian researchers are leading efforts to build open science public-private partnerships that could achieve this security. We just need to invest in it.”  Richard Gold is a James McGill Professor in the Faculty of Law, where he also serves as the Director of Centre for Intellectual Property Policy, and an Associate Member of the Department of Human Genetics. He teaches in the area of intellectual property, international intellectual property, comparative intellectual property, innovation policy and intellectual property management.

Critics of vaccines can now see how lethal a world without a vaccine can be. It also highlights the fact that in a globalized society the development and distribution of vaccines for all infectious diseases is an essential cornerstone of a stable society.”  Jörg Fritz is an Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology and a primary member of the McGill University Research Centre on Complex Traits. His current research aims to better understand the immune response to COVID-19, defining how antiviral immunity functions at a molecular level, in order to develop tests to determine who is immune and inform vaccine development. He also previously worked at Intercell/Valneva and is a co-inventor of the vaccine adjuvant IC31, which currently is being tested in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of several vaccine formulations. jorg.fritz [at] mcgill.ca (English, German) Irah King, Associate Professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology  “The symptoms associated with COVID-19 range from mild cough to acute respiratory failure, but we still don’t know what factors determine disease severity. However, we do know that the vast microbial community living within the intestine, referred to as the microbiome, has a strong influence on our health. One of the most important functions of the microbiome is to regulate how the immune system responds to viruses, even those that infect our respiratory system. Because the composition of our gut microbiome can be changed by lifestyle choices such as diet, sleep patterns and drugs, it should not only be considered in how patients respond to current treatments for COVID-19, but should also be thought of as a target for interventions that limit disease severity.”  Irah King is an Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Canada Research Chair in Barrier Immunity. His current research builds on existing evidence that the gut microbiome affects our immune response to respiratory infection, that evidence of the disease shows up in fecal swabs and stool samples, and that COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms often experience worse outcomes. irah.king [at] mcgill.ca (English) Caroline Wagner, Assistant Professor, Department of Bioengineering  ""We are exploring how factors that affect transmission rates (i.e., non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask-wearing, contact rates between individuals, and climate-driven seasonality), the dynamics of adaptive immune responses, variant emergence, and vaccine availability (including sharing between countries) may impact the future timing and burden of COVID-19 cases.”  Caroline Wagner is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering. Her research interests focus on understanding the role of biological fluids such as mucus in the transmission and pathogenesis of diseases. She studies these questions using a combination of experimental techniques as well as population-level and within-host models of infectious disease dynamics. caroline.wagner [at] mcgill.ca (English) Julian Daniel Sunday Willett, PhD candidate, Program in Quantitative Life Sciences  “While literature suggesting that vaccines offer less protection against the Omicron variant is disconcerting, the same evidence indicates that vaccines still provide a reasonable amount of defense against infection and, importantly, severe disease. A booster dose improves one's protection even further, making it a critical preventative measure for Canadians towards avoiding getting sick or dying from COVID-19. While there remain vaccine skeptics, extensive evidence has demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of this helpful tool.”  Julian Daniel Sunday Willett is a PhD candidate in Quantitative Life Sciences. His research is oriented on SARS-CoV-2 with his thesis hopefully leading to a COVID-19 predictive prognostic model integrating virus and host genomics along with epidemiological data. julian.willett [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English) Testing Dominic Frigon, Associate Professor, Department of Civil Engineering  “Wastewater-based detection of the COVID-19 virus will allow us to monitor in real-time approximately 80% of the Quebec and Canadian populations at a fraction of the cost of doing the current targeted number individual tests. The monitoring would include asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic as well as symptomatic cases, which would allow a faster response of public health authorities. The technique could also allow us to have an unbiased sampling of the proportion of viral lineages circulating in the population, not only the ones associated from cases with the most severe symptoms.”  Dominic Frigon is an Associate Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering, where he specializes in environmental engineering. His research aims at constructing mathematical models describing the dynamics and activity of microbial populations present in wastewater resource recovery systems. He is currently involved in the Canadian Coalition on Wastewater-Related COVID-19 Research and is leading a group of principal investigators from Quebec and members of the Quebec Water Management Research Centre, who is proposing a large project on wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 and preparedness for following pandemics. dominic.frigon [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) David Juncker, Full Professor and Chair, Department of Biomedical Engineering  “Frequent testing using COVID-19 rapid tests could have curbed the pandemic and spared us multiple lockdowns, saved thousands of lives, and billions of dollars by keeping the economy running. Rapid self-tests are now available in many European countries in pharmacies and supermarkets, while in Canada, we are still debating their use. Even as we are vaccinated, rapid testing will still be needed because of people refusing or not eligible for vaccination, waning immunity for the ones vaccinated, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, and seasonality aligned with the one of influenza.”   David Juncker is a Full Professor and Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and a Principal Investigator at the McGill Genome Centre. His research covers new high throughput screening technologies, organ-on-a-chip systems, 3D printing and 3D bioprinting, and clinical and point-of-care diagnostic tests, and most recently, rapid tests for COVID-19. david.juncker [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Sara Mahshid, Assistant Professor, Department of Bioengineering  “The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed critical gaps in diagnostic tests, highlighting the need for rapid and reliable tools in the hands of untrained individuals. Today, with the COVID-19 vaccine global rollout, this ideal testing device should detect the virus and specific antibodies in parallel to inform individuals of the level of the infection and the body’s immunity.”  Sarah Mahshid is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering and an Associate Member of the Department of Biomedical Engineering. She has developed a prototype that can potentially simplify testing of SARS-Cov2 RNA via a colorimetric approach, making it easier and cheaper to manufacture tests, and providing faster results for diagnostics of COVID-19. sara.mahshid [at] mcgill.ca (English) Mark Trifiro, Full Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Experimental Medicine  ""Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is typically used nowadays for diagnosing infections including viruses such as COVID-19. The updated PCR methodology introduces nanoparticle into the PCR reaction and a laser is employed to activate thermocycling a requirement for PCR. Not only does this new technique increases PCR efficiency allowing results in minutes rather than hours, it also allows the design of a battery operated compact portable PCR machine that can be used as a point of care device when the patient is first seen by a health professional for near instant diagnosis.""  Mark Trifiro is a Full Professor in the Department of Medicine and a Senior Investigator at the Lady Davis Institute of the Jewish General Hospital. In collaboration with Andrew Kirk and Miltiadis Paliouras from the Faculty of Engineering, he has developed a revolutionary methodology to construct a portable diagnostic device.

Beyond vaccines to prevent symptomatic COVID-19, therapies are also needed. Immunomodulatory drugs to attenuate the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm may turn out to be an important advance in COVID-19 therapeutics.”  Jean Bourbeau is a Full Professor in the Department of Medicine and a Senior Scientist at the Centre for Outcomes Research and Evaluation as part of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC). He is currently involved in a randomized clinical trial of a new therapy to prevent complications of COVID-19.

For example, oral therapeutics tend to be easy to store and administer and need only be given to the small minority of patients suffering more serious symptoms. In contrast, a large proportion of the population must be inoculated for vaccines to be effective and mRNA-based vaccines require complex logistics to maintain the cold chain, leading to enormous challenges in production, supply, administration and compliance. There is growing consensus that SARS-CoV-2 is too widespread to be eradicated completely and is instead on track to become globally endemic. Considering this state of emergency, researchers and health professionals are racing as never before, and the challenge is to provide results as soon as possible while not cutting corners.”  Nicolas Moitessier is a Full Professor in the Department of Chemistry. His current research interests integrate computational chemistry and organic/medicinal chemistry, spanning from software development to synthetic methodology development. He is currently investigating the use of a combination of computer calculations and laboratory testing to rapidly identify and validate molecules that block an enzyme that is essential to the COVID-19 virus. nicolas.moitessier [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Abhinav Sharma, Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Divisions of Cardiology and Experimental Medicine  “There is controversy with regards to commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs and their role in among patients with a COVID-19 infection. There are several on-going studies that will provide more data on the risk or benefit of these cardiovascular drugs in patients with COVID-19 infection, but there is much to be learned.”  Abhinav Sharma is an Assistant Professor cross-appointed to the Divisions of Cardiology and Experimental Medicine. His current research is trying to determine if a class of commonly-prescribed drugs used for patients with cardiovascular diseases and high blood pressure contributes to outcomes among individuals with a COVID-19 infection, which would provide important guidance for managing heart disease and high blood pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. abhinav.sharma [at] mcgill.ca (English) John White, Full Professor and Chair, Department of Physiology   “There is good evidence from laboratory research that vitamin D can have direct antiviral activity, notably against respiratory viruses. Clinical evidence links vitamin D deficiency to severity of disease in COVID-19 patients and there is some that vitamin D supplementation can improve disease outcome.”  John White is a Full Professor and Chair of the Department of Physiology. As a molecular biologist geneticist who has made numerous broad-ranging contributions to the fields of gene regulation, his works on the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D has opened up the field of the study of vitamin D as an inducer of antimicrobial inmate immunity in humans. john.white [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Vaccine distribution and manufacturing  Susan Kahn, Professor of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine  “Thrombosis (blood clots) has come to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic. First as it became evident that COVID-19 patients, particularly those who require hospitalization, have an increased risk of developing severe blood clots. Also later as it emerged that an unusual type of blood clot associated with an immune reaction and a drop in platelet count was a rare occurrence after some COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Researchers continue to work to understand the mechanisms of both COVID-19-associated thrombosis and vaccine- associated thrombosis.”  Susan Kahn is a Professor of Medicine in the Department of Medicine and the founder and director of the Centre of Excellence in Thrombosis and Anticoagulation Care.

Despite the development of several highly-effective vaccines, their distribution has not been even across the globe and the vast majority of doses have been delivered in wealthy nations. Several variants of the original virus with very different characteristics (e.g., transmissibility, pathogenicity, resistance to vaccine-induced protection, etc.) have emerged and continue to circulate in many parts of the world. In regions with high vaccine availability, the pandemic continues to do great damage among those who have chosen not to be vaccinated. Greater attention needs to be paid to equitable distribution of vaccines, to the issues around vaccine hesitancy and to the development of new vaccination strategies that can provide broad protection against the variants (e.g., booster doses, combination vaccines, etc.).”  Brian Ward is a Full Professor in the Department of Medicine, an Associate Member of the Centre for Host-Parasite Interactions and a Senior Scientist at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC).

Experts: Russia's invasion of Ukraine,11 May 2022,"Published: 11May2022  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      In a speech delivered from Russia's famous Red Square, Russian President Vladimir Putin marked Victory Day and blamed Western policies for Moscow's military action in Ukraine. While Western analysts in recent weeks had widely expected Putin to use the holiday to trumpet some kind of victory in Ukraine or announce an escalation, he did neither. Instead, he sought to justify the war again as a necessary response to what he portrayed as a hostile Ukraine. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue:  Featured expert - Foreign policy  ""The current events in Ukraine pose significant challenges for the entire United Nations system, and particularly the UN Security Council, as well as the legal frameworks that exist to regulate armed conflict and facilitate humanitarian assistance. Russia's invasion is also challenging the very essence of diplomacy, which rests on the assumption that states can be encouraged to moderate or change their behaviour. In the case of Russia currently, events both foreign and domestic are being driven by the ideas and beliefs of a single individual, whose moves have been difficult to predict. Western countries, which failed to dissuade Putin from invading his neighbor, must now rest their hopes on two things: first, the capacity of punishing sanctions to test the loyalty of Putin's supporters and make his financing of the war more and more difficult; and second, the ability of a small set of countries who have not condemned his invasion outright — such as China — to have some influence over the Russian leader's behaviour. In the meantime, Western states must do all they can to support Ukraine's fight without crossing a line that would lead to dangerous escalation of the conflict.

Increasingly, we see terms such a resiliency, robustness and visibility being used by industry to characterize their efforts to stabilize supply chain performance, but questions remain.

Inventory levels will remain relatively stable in these regions and — as long as they are not directly attacked — will continue to honor their production commitments even if the conflict extends for years. However, we will see the adoption of a ‘lean’ inventory strategy, producing only enough to sell, not holding any overstock to respond to price hikes or provide emergency shipments. On the other hand, we can expect that Ukrainian suppliers will continue to be reliable and find their way to supply as usual. The difference is that international firms will expect to receive smaller, more frequent shipments from abroad, as opposed to large infrequent shipments and will no longer be able to demand last-minute emergency supplies, or additional goods (on top of what was contractually agreed).”  Juan Camilo Serpa is an Associate Professor of Operations Management in the Desautels Faculty of Management.

F-35s alone won't get us there. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has laid bare the consequences for global security when states like the US and Canada signal that they are not committed to the norms and institutions that have helped prevent a third world war for over 75 years. A major increase in Canada's defence budget will therefore miss the mark if it isn't accompanied by a major recommitment to Canada's role in international cooperation and universal human rights. This means that we stop trading our values for our business interests in China and around the world. It means Canada taking a leadership role at the United Nations in defence of international norms of behaviour. And it means a genuine, sustained reengagement by the Canadian Armed Forces in international peacekeeping activities.

(CBC News)  Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology   “The workers’ victory at the JFK8 Amazon fulfillment center is a true David vs. Goliath story. Not only is it the first-ever Amazon facility to vote to unionize in North America, but with more than 8,000 workers in the facility, it is one of the largest private-sector union organizing wins in at least 30 years. What is particularly noteworthy is that the JFK8 workers prevailed against one of the largest, most viciously anti-union companies in the world largely on their own, without the backing of a major union, without paid organizing and legal staff, without many of the key resources that are a standard part of most union organizing campaigns. That is likely making Amazon management nervous, but it should also be a wake-up call for unions to re-think their organizing strategies.

He has a long-standing interest in how ancient societies both altered biogeochemical cycles and were impacted by past climate change.  peter.douglas [at] mcgill.ca (English)  James P. Williams, PhD candidate, Department of Civil Engineering   “I think the new plan is a reasonably positive step towards meeting Canada's emission reductions goals. It highlights methane emissions and targets the oil and gas industry quite heavily and promises progress reports at regular intervals which should help with accountability, which is critical given our track history with past targets. I wish there was more focus on performing emissions measurements and improving the detail of greenhouse gas inventories at national, provincial, and municipal levels since these are ways that we can clearly identify targets for cost-effective mitigation strategies.”   James P. Williams is a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil Engineering. He has been working on direct and indirect measurements of greenhouse emissions for the past several years. His work mostly focuses on methane emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells and emissions from urban environments.  philip.williams [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English)     Contact Information Contact: Claire Loewen Organization: Media Relations, McGill University Email: claire.loewen [at] mcgill.ca Mobile Phone: 438-837-3735",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Canada', 'carbon emissions', 'Emissions reduction', 'External', 'Federal government', 'methane emissions']"
Experts: Does Quebec's secularism law speak to the younger generation?,18 Mar 2022,"Published: 18Mar2022  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Researchers from McGill and Concordia universities have teamed up to examine how Quebec's secularism law, Law 21, is affecting the career choices and experiences of discrimination of students, particularly in the province's faculties of law and education. The law, which bans some public servants, including teachers in the public system and prosecutors, from wearing religious symbols at work, was implemented in June 2019. The researchers sent out an on-line bilingual survey between mid-October 2020 and early November 2021 and invited volunteers to send in written comments as well as survey responses. 51% of students surveyed indicated that they would look for work outside Quebec because of Law 21. The results raise the possibility of a generation gap in Quebec between the older generation, who are informed by a particular set of historical experiences, and the younger people who are the teachers and lawyers of tomorrow.  Here are two experts who can provide comment on this issue: Elizabeth Elbourne, Associate Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “We noticed many students shared their deep distress at witnessing the impact of the Law’s passage on their classmates, family members, friends and fellow students. A number of students in Education left comments indicating that they were unwilling to teach in Quebec because of Law 21, despite not being directly personally affected.”  Elizabeth Elbourne is an Associate Professor in McGill University’s Department of History and Classical Studies. She is a historian of religion, colonialism, gender, and human rights.  She became interested in the project both because it dovetailed with her historical interests and because she wanted to explore some of the wider issues around this complex question.   elizabeth.elbourne [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Kimberley Manning, Associate Professor, Departement of Political Science, Concordia University  “If we think of students as largely young people, these findings suggest a lack of support by youth, particularly in Montreal. This raises the possibility of a generational gap concerning attitudes toward Law 21 that is deserving of further research and attention by lawmakers.”  Kimberley Manning is Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Concordia University and the former principal of the Simone de Beauvoir Institute. She became interested in the project as she witnessed the impact of the Law on friends and colleagues. If professionals in education and law were struggling under the law, how were program students faring? kimberley.manning [at] concordia.ca (English)    Contact Information Contact: Claire Loewen Organization: Media Relations, McGill University Email: claire.loewen [at] mcgill.ca Mobile Phone: 438-837-3735",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['bill 21', 'Concordia University', 'Elizabeth Elbourne', 'External', 'Kimberley Manning', 'McGill University']"

Even though endometriosis has been researched extensively, it is a complex disease that can be challenging to diagnose and treat. (Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Togas Tulandi, Full Professor and Chair, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology  “It is estimated that over 170 million women worldwide suffer from endometriosis. It is found in up to 50% of women with infertility and 70% of those with pelvic pain. Other manifestations of endometriosis include painful periods and/or intercourse, it may also be linked to anxiety and depression, and reduced quality of life. Treatment depends on several factors such as age, desire to conceive, and severity of the symptoms.”  Togas Tulandi is a Full Professor and Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, where he also serves at the Milton Leong Chair in Reproductive Medicine, and the Obstetrician and Gynecologist-in-Chief at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).

(Status of Women Canada) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Social justice and advocacy Chloe Garcia, Sessional Instructor, Department of Integrated Studies in Education  “In our media saturated environment and connected lives, it is more important than ever to see women and girls using media and digital spaces to express and advocate for themselves and others, share stories, call out oppressive norms and institutions, or just be themselves. There is still a way to go, with digital spaces contending with the same offline gender politics and politics that marginalize and make invisible women and girls, particularly those that fall outside the White, cis-het, narratives. Today, I celebrate everyone, and urge those in positions of power to take action to help make visible those who need a platform.”  Chloe Garcia is a recent PhD graduate and a sessional instructor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education. Her research revolves around digital and media literacies, youth digital media products, sex education and sexual and gender-based violence. She is currently working on curriculum development and research for the PortraitX initiative, led by the community organization Raison d’Art. chloe.garcia [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Shaheen Shariff, James McGill Professor, Department of Integrated Studies in Education   “On this day, I think about two of the most inspirational women in my life. My mother (who sadly died in 2020), and daughter, who recently achieved her lifelong goal of becoming a surgeon. My mother had less opportunity for education beyond elementary school, had boundless energy and patience, never letting cancer slow her down. My daughter shares that energy and, ironically, operates on cancer patients.  In 2022, International Women’s Day comes at an important crossroads in history. As we emerge from a difficult pandemic, we witness a resurgence of misogyny, patriarchy, normalized gender-based violence, online misinformation, and intersecting discrimination that places women and girls at greater risk of losing hard won progress towards equality. To reverse this relapse, we will need to work harder and smarter to help all young women achieve their career goals. We must do this through focused education, sustained economic empowerment, and research informed government incentives and policies.”   Shaheen Shariff is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education and Associate Member of the Faculty of Law. Her work is centered on the intersection of education, law and policy, with a focus on constitutional, human rights and civil law as it impacts educational institutions.

Valerie.orsat [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Audrey Moores, Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry   “It is well recognized that women account for fewer graduates than men in a number of STEM fields, but recent data from Canada looking at career paths 10 years after graduation indicates that there is more attrition of women than men in these careers. This discrepancy explains in part the gender gap we see in salaries, because salaries in STEM jobs are typically higher than average. This is even more troublesome when we realize that STEM jobs are at the heart of the sustainability revolution needed to combat climate change. UN data shows that women are likely to be more affected by the negative effects of climate change than men, and yet they are more likely to be excluded from the solution. We have the responsibility to advocate, reach out to and mentor those around us to reduce this gap, but strong political action is also needed to see significant change.”   Audrey Moores is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry.

Experts: Canadian inflation hits a new three-decade high,23 Feb 2022,"Published: 23Feb2022  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Inflation hit a new three-decade high in January, heaping more pressure on the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates for the first time since the pandemic started. The consumer price index rose 5.1 per cent in January from a year earlier, accelerating from December’s pace of 4.8 per cent and marking the first time since 1991 that inflation has surpassed 5 per cent, according to Statistics Canada. It was the 10th consecutive month that inflation has exceeded the Bank of Canada’s target range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent. (Globe and Mail) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Canadian economy and Bank of Canada Moshe Lander, Course Lecturer, Department of Economics  “The current inflation that Canada is experiencing is transitory in nature and supply side-driven, due to the perfect confluence of COVID-19, natural disasters, supply-chain disruptions and rising global tensions. Most inflationary pressure usually originated in the demand side and the Bank of Canada is much more capable of managing this. Unfortunately, supply-side inflation is much harder for the Bank to control. If the current round of inflation does not spill over into increasing wage demands, then it will dissipate as soon as the various supply-side issues go away. If it does spill over into increasing wage demands, then the Bank will have to act aggressively likely triggering a deep recession that could destabilize the housing and financial markets.”  Moshe Lander is a Course Lecturer in the Department of Economics, where he teaches classes on economic statistics, econometries and financial institutions. His areas of expertise include inflation, recession and unemployment. moshe.lander [at] mcgill.ca (English, French, German, Spanish) Rising food prices Pascal Thériault, Faculty Lecturer, Farm Management and Technology Program  “Consumers have been more aware of their food choices ever since the pandemic started. Some food commodities were affected more than others by the pandemic, but we can see larger trends in food prices. Climate change is also a factor that had an impact and that will continue to have a greater impact on food production not just in Canada but everywhere. For many years now, Canadians had the chance to have one of the cheapest ‘baskets of food’ in the world, quite a feat for a northern country. We are not seeing the market catch up on certain commodities, while others have increased at the same rate as salaries.”  Pascal Thériault is a Faculty Lecturer in the Farm Management and Technology Program and the Director of Community Relations at the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.

The theme for Black History Month 2022 is February and Forever: Celebrating Black History today and every day. (Canadian Heritage) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey, Assistant Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “History is power. History is self-determination. Those who have power to exercise self-determination have power to control the writing and promotion of their history. Therefore, celebrating Black history and Black History Month is more than a perfunctory exercise that acknowledges Black people throughout the African Diaspora and Africa. Teaching, researching, and promoting the history of a globally subordinated and subjugated racial group is an innocuous yet profoundly revolutionary act of self-determination.”  Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies and a historian of post-Reconstruction United States, specializing on the African American experience. His research focuses on the intersections of the United States, Canada, and the African Diaspora. wendell.adjetey [at] mcgill.ca (English) Kimani Daniel, Faculty Lecturer, Ingram School of Nursing   “Black History Month is an essential opportunity to celebrate the vibrancy and contributions of the Black community to Canadian history. However, this celebration should be seen as part of the year-long need to see positive reflections of the community in building our present-day society. This recognition of our shared history is important for the health and well-being of everyone.”  Kimani Daniel is a Faculty Lecturer in the Ingram School of Nursing. In her role as clinical nurse specialist in maternal-child health at the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux du Centre-Ouest-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, she was the site lead for the quality improvement program, MOREOB, a comprehensive performance improvement program that creates a culture of patient safety in obstetrical units. kimani.daniel [at] mcgill.ca (English) Philip S. S. Howard, Assistant Professor, Department of Integrated Studies in Education  “Black History Month is an important opportunity for celebration, affirmation, and focused attention within Black communities that are doing the daily work of asserting our humanity. This is yet another occasion where Black persons and Black communities can embrace the Black joy inherent in celebrating the ways in which we have made Black life despite the ubiquity of anti-Blackness. In dominant institutions, however, the celebratory cannot and should not be allowed to take the place of accountability and responsibility displayed through meaningful and substantive attention to dismantling institutional anti-Black racism that extend beyond Black History Month.”  Philip S. S. Howard is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies. He works in the areas of critical race studies, anti-colonial studies, and antiblackness in education. His current research projects investigate contemporary Canadian blackface as a postracialist phenomenon, and Black people’s agency in educational contexts in Toronto, Halifax, and Montreal. philip.howard [at] mcgill.ca (English) Myrna Lashley, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry  ""We must ALL face, and truthfully confront, our collective history. In so doing, we can start the process of co-constructing a new world and work together toward the creation of spaces in which we are all equal and for which we have shared responsibility. In this manner, one group will no longer be placed into the position of 'waiting, asking or begging' to be viewed as worthy to be invited in.

It is a time to speak to our triumphs and various histories, a time to speak about who we were before slavery and colonization, how we continue to move towards a form of liberation that supports and celebrates the lives and many contributions of Black trans folks, Black women and Black queer folks; and how we now live, function and flourish in a world that is, in many ways, anti-Black.""  Emmanuel Tabi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education.

Technology is paramount for the advancement of multilingual education, especially during and post-COVID-19. In multilingual education, it is important that educators choose tools that allow learners to access and create content in different languages and not only in the language of instruction. For example, learners can access content about a topic in different languages and collaboratively create artifacts such as a digital multilingual poster, or a digital storytelling in different languages, which can be shared with members of their family and in their communities.”    Angelica Galante is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education.

Heart disease affects approximately 2.4 million Canadian adults, and is the second leading cause of death in Canada. (Government of Canada)  Valentine’s Day brings up important questions related to consumerism, love and relationships, and other topics.  Here are some experts from McGill University who can provide comment on these topics:  On the impact of intimate relationships:   Sarah Brauner-Otto, Associate Professor, Department of Sociology   “Although we readily recognize the importance of intimate relationships in the lives of individuals, we also need to recognize that those relationships influence others and may do so over long periods. We see that the emotional dynamics within marriages may influence many domains of their children’s lives – such as their work, family, recreation, attitudes, and values – and may do so well beyond the time that children are living in their parents’ home.”   Sarah Brauner-Otto is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and Director of the Centre on Population Dynamics. She is a social demographer studying global family change with a focus on the relationship between social contexts.   sarah.brauner-otto [at] mcgill.ca (English)   On how chocolate impacts our health:  Christopher Labos, Associate, Office for Science and Society   “The studies linking chocolate to health benefits are not definitive studies. Firstly, the studies themselves are usually not done with people actually eating chocolate but rather by giving people antioxidants or other compounds found in chocolate and then drawing some inference about health benefits. What is often neglected is that the manufacturing process destroys many of these purportedly beneficial compounds.”  On maintaining heart health:  Christopher Labos, Associate, Office for Science and Society  “There are very simple things we can do to maintain our cardiovascular health. If you exercise regularly, don’t smoke, eat a healthy diet of mainly fruits and vegetables, and monitor medical factors like blood pressure cholesterol and diabetes, then you have controlled the majority of potential cardiovascular risks.”  Christopher Labos completed his cardiology residency at McGill University where he served as chief resident and then completed a master’s degree in epidemiology before pursuing a research fellowship.  He is currently a cardiologist at Hôpital Notre-Dame and an Associate with the Science and Society at McGill whose mission is to promote critical thinking and present science to the public.    christopher.labos [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)  Abhinav Sharma, Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Divisions of Cardiology and Experimental Medicine  ""Maintaining physical activity is an important part of heart health. If you want to incorporate more physical activity in your daily routine, try taking small incremental steps where possible. For example, stop one floor below where you need to go and walk up one flight of stairs; take a walk around the block when you park your car at home or the garage; or even just stand for a few minutes an hour every day while you work. Done consistently, small additions to your daily routine can have huge heart health benefits over time.""     Abhinav Sharma is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. His research currently focuses on cardiovascular outcomes and therapy optimization in patients with diabetes and heart failure and the use of digital health to streamline follow-up and therapy selection in patients with heart failure.   Abhinav.sharma [at] mcgill.ca (English)  On the chemistry of love:   Joe Schwarcz, Director, Office for Science and Society  “Often, we hear of two people having the ‘right chemistry’. Are our romantic links really controlled by chemicals? What does science say about this? There is also a lot of interest in purported aphrodisiacs. Science delves into this area as well.”  Joe Schwarcz is the Director of the Office for Science and Society, which has the mission of separating sense from nonsense.

This Day is an opportunity to promote full and equal access to and participation in science for women and girls. Gender equality is a global priority for UNESCO, and the support of young girls, their education and their full ability to make their ideas heard are levers for development and peace.   Tackling some of the greatest challenges of the Agenda for Sustainable Development -- from improving health to combating climate change -- will rely on harnessing all talent. That means getting more women working in these fields. Diversity in research expands the pool of talented researchers, bringing in fresh perspectives, talent and creativity. This Day is a reminder that women and girls play a critical role in science and technology communities and that their participation should be strengthened. (UNESCO)   Here are some experts from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue:  Daryl Haggard, Associate Professor, Department of Physics   “Women and girls are making high-impact discoveries in science. Recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics speak to the importance of these contributions. Yet both structural and cultural challenges remain. The international community’s commitment to science and gender equity is crucial to continuing the development of this talent.

In North America, only 20.6% of bachelor's degrees in computer science are awarded to women. Yet, the future is digital. Increasing the participation of women in computing is not only vital for our economy to meet the increasing demand for IT jobs, but also for our society in general.  I am proud that at McGill we have over 37% women majoring in computer science today. We have achieved this by removing entry barriers and giving every student the chance to learn about computing through our highly popular set of introductory courses in programming. While many barriers still exist, this makes me hopeful that we are moving in the right direction and our next generation of students will reshape computer science and more broadly its impact on our society.”    Brigitte Pientka is a full professor in the School of Computer Science. Her research focuses on foundations of programming languages to build reliable and safe software.

Yet as one progresses in a scientific career, the proportion of women decreases. The reasons for this gender gap are complex, but we have gained insight into its causes by studying it scientifically. I am encouraged by the proactive, evidence-based steps taken by Canadian universities and funding agencies to promote diversity and inclusion in science. I firmly believe that the gender gap in science is a solvable problem.”    Alanna Watt is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biology at McGill University.

This discrepancy explains in part the gender gap we see in salaries, because salaries in STEM jobs are typically higher than average. This is even more troublesome when we realize that STEM jobs are at the heart of the sustainability revolution needed to combat climate change. UN data shows that women are likely to be more affected by the negative effects of climate change than men, and yet they are more likely to be excluded from the solution. We have the responsibility to advocate, reach out to and mentor those around us to reduce this gap, but strong political action is also needed to see significant change.”     Audrey Moores is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry at McGill University.

Experts: Remaining trucker convoy protesters won’t leave until COVID-19 restrictions ease,2 Feb 2022,"Published: 2Feb2022  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Crowds have thinned out considerably on Parliament Hill and the surrounding area, where anti-COVID restrictions demonstrators have been protesting for days. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will not meet with anyone involved, noting reports that some participants have been seen harassing local businesses, waving Nazi flags, defecating on residential lawns, urinating on National War Memorial and stealing food from the homeless. (Global News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “The ‘Freedom Convoy’ against vaccine mandates and passports puts Erin O’Toole and his party in a tough political position, which may prove to be electorally challenging for them over the long-term. They need to take into account both the rise of the People’s Party of Canada in the polls and the preferences of the majority of Canadians who support many of the public health measures that the protesters have gathered in Ottawa to oppose.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and a James McGill Professor in the Department of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Shannon Sampert, Eakin Visiting Fellow in Canadian Studies, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada   ""There is much to be concerned about in the 'Freedom Convoy' and, in particular, the participation of the alt-right element in the movement. While there are those who will say they are outliers, one of the main organizers of the Go Fund Me page, Tamara Lich, is involved with the Maverick Party, does not believe in climate change and is openly anti-immigration. No one can be surprised by what happened in Ottawa over the weekend given the Yellow Vest protests in 2019. No credible politician should be speaking with these protesters when there are Nazi flags and protest signs calling for the assassination of the Prime Minister.""  Shannon Sampert recently joined the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada as the Eakin Visiting Fellow in Canadian Studies, where she is teaching a course on public affairs and leadership in Canada.

Experts: International Day of Education | January 24,20 Jan 2022,"Published: 20Jan2022  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed January 24 as the International Day of Education, in celebration of the role of education for peace and development. The theme of the fourth International Day of Education is “Changing Course, Transforming Education.” Transforming the future requires an urgent rebalancing or our relationships with each other, with nature as well as with technology that permeates our lives, bearing breakthrough opportunities while raising serious concerns for equity, inclusion and democratic participation (UNESCO).   Here are some experts from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue:   Tina Montreuil, Associate Professor, Department of Educational Counseling and Psychology    “Education was already on a transformational path and changing slowly prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now the ongoing nature of the pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we define educational curricula and related learning objectives, particularly in relation to shaping global citizenship. There are challenges and opportunities in having to rely on technology to support learning while at the same time doing our best to preserve human interactions, particularly as we continue working together to promote equity, diversity and inclusion.”    Tina Montreuil is an Associate Professor in the department of Educational and Counselling Psychology and an Associate Member of the department of Psychiatry at McGill University. Her current research focuses on, among other topics, how symptoms of mental health problems might interfere with self-regulated learning in a group context and ultimately, educational achievement.   Tina.montreuil [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)   Bronwen Low, Associate Professor, Department of Integrated Studies in Education    “Significant inequities in our education system were exposed and deepened early on in  the COVID-19 pandemic. These inequities included schools’ ability and preparedness to adopt new modes of instruction, the digital divide, availability of adult support, and access to quiet study spaces at home, which all shaped the experience of remote learning. The inequities also included the differing vulnerabilities and needs of children of ‘remote’ vs. ‘essential’ workers, and the ways that overcrowded and poorly maintained and ventilated public school buildings increased the possibilities of transmission. Two years later, most schools and families are better prepared to adapt to pandemic restrictions and changes, but these inequities still exist.""   Bronwen Low is an Associate Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education.

For education, this has intensified the need to rebalance concerns related to equity, diversity and inclusion; in order for some to learn to listen more, as others raise their voices. Complicated curricular conversations that confront prejudice, one’s own positionality, the historical legacies of human rights violations and how the interconnections between relationships with nature and technologies merge and emerge at the forefront.  On this International Day of Education, we have the opportunity to re-think, re-consider, and re-imagine (in order to re-emerge) together, as we seek connection and becoming for/with all. Education is the greatest equalizer and hope for a just society.”    Mindy R.

Experts: One-year anniversary of the January 6 U.S. Capitol riot,5 Jan 2022,"Published: 5Jan2022  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver remarks to mark the one-year anniversary of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The insurrection, which began as members of Congress worked to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, commanded the nation's attention as violent scenes of rioters attacking officers and destroying parts of the Capitol were broadcast live across the country. (CNN) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey, Assistant Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “In the past few years, pundits have lamented the decline of democracy in the United States. One must ask: Democracy for whom? The hallmarks of civil unrest and strife in the United States are not the result of a waning democracy or democratic institutions, but rather a ruling class that is trying to maintain the appearance of order and civility while the masses continue to experience social despair and material insecurity.”  Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies and a historian of post-Reconstruction United States, specializing on the African American experience. His research focuses on the intersections of the United States, Canada, and African Diaspora. wendell.adjetey [at] mcgill.ca (English) Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “While many view Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election as a dangerous erosion of U.S. democratic norms, they do highlight just how undemocratic existing U.S. political institutions are. As delusional as his efforts to ‘find’ fictitiously missing Trump votes was, the ‘stop the steal’ narrative his supporters spun in the aftermath of the election could only seem remotely plausible in a context where an unrepresentative Electoral College and arcane election rules giving inordinate power to state legislatures turned Biden’s seven million popular vote majority into a situation where a few thousand votes in a few key states could change the election outcome. The modern Republican Party has doubled down on a minoritarian strategy that is far out of step with a majority of U.S. voters, but they are only able to do so because of the undemocratic political infrastructure in which they operate.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology. As a comparative historical sociologist, his research explores the changing relationship between social mobilization, political processes, and ideology in advanced capitalist democracies. barry.eidlin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Mugambi Jouet, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Law  “The assault on the Capitol crystallized the growing polarization of the United States over a host of social, political, legal, religious, and racial issues. The polarization has old roots in distinctive dimensions of American society, although it intensified remarkably during the Bush, Obama, Trump, and now the Biden presidencies.”  Mugambi Jouet is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law. His research focuses on criminal justice and comparative government from a multidisciplinary perspective. He is an expert on the distinctive historical evolution of American law, institutions, and sociopolitical culture compared to other Western democracies such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European nations. mugambi.jouet [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Jason Opal, Associate Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “Of all the factors that may account for America's current political crisis, two stand out as the most salient. First, many far-right groups that explicitly reject politics in favor of violence (e.g.; the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo Boys, the Three Percenters, the Oath Keepers, etc.) have merged with core elements of the institutional Republican Party, often at the local, county, or state level; and second, the leader of the Party, Donald Trump, has absolutely no regard whatsoever for the bare constitutional minimum of democracy, that is the basic rules set up in 1787 for a separation of powers, the rule of law, and peaceful transitions of authority. This is what led to the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and what prevents a due reckoning of those responsible for it, including Trump himself.”  Jason Opal is an Associate Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies, where he teaches and writes about the US Constitution in different periods of American history.

Experts: 2021 Holiday Season ,20 Dec 2021,"Published: 20Dec2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The McGill Media Relations Office suggests the following sources for your holiday stories: Exercise and staying active | Giving back | Mental health |  New Year's resolutions and goals | Safer holidays |Sustainable tree shopping | Traveling during the Holidays | Exercise and staying active Steven Grover, Full Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine  “There is increasing evidence that the social isolation surrounding the pandemic has led to more stress, anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality, weight gain, and sedentary behaviour. Regular exercise has been consistently proven to be a highly effective therapy to both prevent and treat these health conditions. Accordingly, exercising daily is arguably among the most important treatments available to improve our physical and mental health during the pandemic, and all year long.”  Steven Grover is a Full Professor in the Department of Medicine and the Director of the Comprehensive Health Improvement Program. His research focuses on the importance of exercise, healthy eating, and other lifestyle interventions to improve health, as well as on digital, e-health interventions using web-based platforms. steven.grover [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Giving back Hillary Kaell, Associate Professor, Department of Anthropology and School of Religious Studies  ""The holiday season is characterized by a major yearly spike in North American giving. It's a key time to reflect on the history of how and why we give to charity and what kinds of organizations we often support. The holidays are also the most obvious time when North America's majority religion – Christianity – shapes our public culture. Christianity has a deep influence on our society's norms, perspectives, and laws, though it often goes unrecognized or labelled as 'secular'. Understanding this history, including the history of many public holidays, can help us better know our culture and potentially address inequities.""  Hillary Kaell is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Department of Anthropology and the School of Religious Studies, where she specializes in the history and practice of Christianity in North America. Much of her work uses material and sensory studies to examine aspects of capitalism, consumption, and monetization, for example in tourism, heritage creation, or charitable corporations. She also has an abiding interest in how U.S. Christians foster real and imagined connections with symbolically resonant sites faraway, such as the Holy Land or the Global Church. hillary.kaell [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Eric Latimer, Full Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “The rising cost of housing is also a cause of homelessness. The supply of apartments at the bottom end of the quality spectrum needs to be increased – developers have been mainly focusing instead on higher-end condos because that’s where they can make the most money. The government’s recently announced plan to end the Accès-Logis program and instead subsidize the construction of so-called affordable housing in the private sector is good in one respect, in that it has the potential to increase the supply of lower-cost apartments, which in turn will help to keep rents down. But people with low incomes are likely to need additional help to be able to live in these apartments.”   Eric Latimer is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Director of the Mental Health and Society Research Program at the Douglas Research Centre. A health economist, his research interests focus on community-based supports for people with severe mental illness, particularly their economic aspects. eric.latimer [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Daiva Nielsen, Assistant Professor, School of Human Nutrition  “Food insecurity is a complex issue characterized by an inability to access a sufficient quantity or variety of food due to financial constraints. During the holiday season, households that experience food insecurity may face heightened challenges and anxiety around obtaining food. It may be more difficult for these households to use food to uphold traditions and share meals with loved ones. Making donations to or volunteering with local organizations that aim to support the less fortunate may help to make the holiday period less difficult and more enjoyable for those who face food insecurity.”  Daiva Nielsen is an Assistant Professor in the School of Human Nutrition. She is currently leading a study to compare household food procurement experiences across different regions in Quebec, including those more affected by COVID-19. daiva.nielsen [at] mcgill.ca (English) Mental health Tina Montreuil, Assistant Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology  “Over the holidays, chronic and persistent uncertainty can drain our cognitive resources which can lead to more generalized physical exhaustion and eventual mental breakdown. Omicron has the potential to further challenge our ability to tolerate uncertainty, which is a critical factor in a resilient mindset and general sense of well-being. As a way of responding to ongoing adversity, it is important to continue relying on key coping strategies such as acceptance, tolerance, and self-care.”  Tina Montreuil is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology and an Associate Member of the Department of Psychiatry. Her research focuses on investigating the role of emotion regulation, attitudes, and beliefs on the development and intergenerational transmission of psychopathology and how symptoms of mental health problems might interfere with self-regulated learning in a group context and ultimately, educational achievement. tina.montreuil [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) New Year's resolutions and goals Richard Koestner, Full Professor, Department of Psychology  “We are nearing the 2nd year anniversary of the onset COVID-19 pandemic and most of us are anxious about the continued uncertainty regarding when we will be able to return to our previous lives. Given this uncertainty (and a high level of fatigue), many of us will struggle to use the holiday period to make goals for the new year. Although difficult in the present context, it is important for us to make new goals because this is how we give direction, meaning and hope to our lives. I recommend two kinds of goals this year – ones that provide order and structure to our daily routines (e.g., re-establishing boundaries between work and leisure) and ones that focus on making sure we satisfy our fundamental human needs. What we really need right now are social goals that enhance our connections to other individuals, groups, and communities.”  Richard Koestner is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychology and the head of the McGill Human Motivation Lab. For more than 30 years, he has been conducting research on goal-setting, self-regulation and internalization processes. richard.koestner [at] mcgill.ca (English) Safer holidays Matthew Oughton, Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases  ""Widespread use of approved vaccines for COVID-19 have made gatherings this Christmas safer than a year ago. However, risks of disease transmission remain, particularly for the unvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated. Fewer gatherings, smaller gatherings, outdoor settings, and limiting gatherings to those who are fully vaccinated are all ways of making holiday get-togethers safer and more relaxing for all.""  Matthew Oughton is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine and a specialist in infectious diseases and medical microbiology. He is based at the Jewish General Hospital, where he supervises the bacteriology and molecular microbiology laboratories. His research interests are focused on the use of molecular techniques to improve clinical diagnostic assays, with relevant publications on C. difficile, MRSA, influenza, and other pathogens. matthew.oughton [at] mcgill.ca (English) Sustainable tree shopping David Wees, Faculty Lecturer, Department of Plant Science  “Real Christmas trees look nicer, smell nicer and can be ‘greener’ than artificial trees (which are often made from fossil fuels). However, if the thought of killing a tree for a few weeks of indoor decoration makes one squeamish, consider using just branches of spruce or fir instead of a whole tree. Alternatively, you could take a more radical approach and decorate a potted green plant like a jade plant or a Norfolk pine: they last much longer than cut trees and are just as green.”  David Wees is Faculty Lecturer in the Department of Plant Science and the Associate Director of the Farm Management and Technology Program. He teaches courses in all aspects of horticulture: vegetable production, fruit production, greenhouses, urban horticulture and landscaping. david.wees [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Traveling during the Holidays John Gradek, Faculty Lecturer, School of Continuing Studies  “The 2021 holiday season will be remembered as one that started off with great promise for family get-togethers, gatherings with friends and the potential for long-delayed travel, with airlines offering both capacity and services to accommodate this pent-up demand. With the Omicron variant spreading world-wide and the return of severe health restrictions in many jurisdictions, anxiety and concern has dampened the travel spirit. As the world adjusts to dealing with the COVID-19 endemic, Canadian aviation will need to adjust both its holiday operating plans and beyond to limit financial risk yet be ready to deal with renewed demand.”  John Gradek is lecturing in the Diploma program in Integrated Aviation Management as well as in both the certificate and diploma programs of Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Operations Management.

Expert: U.S. diplomats to boycott 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,8 Dec 2021,"Published: 8Dec2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The United States has announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in China – a move that has been heavily criticized by Beijing. The White House said no official delegation would be sent to the Games because of concerns about China's human rights record but said U.S. athletes could attend and would have the government's full support. (BBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: René Provost, Full Professor, Faculty of Law  “A diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics is a measured and meaningful response to evidence that Chinese authorities are engaged in acts of genocide and other serious violations of human rights. Other governments should, in concert, follow in the footsteps of the United States. Such a gesture is not grounded in a deluded belief that it can force China to change its behaviour, but rather for the purpose of making human rights issues a necessary part of any conversation on any topic with China. Engagement with governments that violate human rights, if it addresses the issue squarely, is more likely to lead to a change of behaviour than a complete disengagement.”  René Provost is a Full Professor in the Faculty of Law and a full member of the Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism.

(UNESCO)   Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue:   Katherine Lofts, Senior Research Associate, Faculty of Law   “The impacts of climate change have a disproportionate impact on the lives, livelihoods, and wellbeing of persons with disabilities. Yet, although disabled persons account for approximately 15% of the world's population and are disproportionally affected by climate impacts, they have been largely excluded in the field of climate change.”   Katherine Lofts is a Senior Research Associate in the Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Program and a Legal Research Fellow at the Centre for International Sustainable Development Law, both housed under the Faculty of Law. Her research interests include criminal accountability for violations of economic, social, cultural, and environmental rights; gender and sustainable development; rights-based approaches to climate change and climate-compatible development.  katherine.lofts [at] mcgill.ca (English)  Karyn Moffatt, Associate Professor, School of Information Studies   “People with disabilities unfortunately continue to be seen as peripheral rather than active and valued participants in society and are often especially forgotten in the design of technology. When they are considered, they are almost exclusively viewed through the one-dimensional lens of their disability. This underscores the importance of initiatives like the International Day of Persons with Disability, which forefronts not only the rights of people with disabilities but also promotes and recognizes their contributions.  It is imperative that we do more to recognize that people with disabilities are (like everyone else) complex individuals with wide ranging desires and needs. Their potential uses for technology expand well beyond compensatory tools, and designers of technology should seek out these opportunities for innovation.”   Karyn Moffatt is an Associate Professor in the School of Information Studies and holds the Canada Research Chair in Inclusive Social Computing. Her research interests include Accessibility of computer systems. computer-mediated communication within families and across generations, human-computer interaction and interactive technologies for older users and individuals with disabilities.  karyn.moffatt [at] mcgill.ca (English)   Jonathan Sterne, James McGill Professor, Department of Art History & Communication Studies   “The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the possibilities for widespread disability accommodation and greater access for all. However, at the same time, it has reinforced beliefs and practices that the lives and livelihoods of disabled and chronically ill people somehow count less than those of everyone else.”   Jonathan Sterne is a James McGill Professor in Culture and Technology in the Department of Art History & Communication Studies. His scholarly work focuses on the cultural dimensions of communication technologies, especially their form and role in large-scale societies.   jonathan.sterne [at] mcgill.ca (English)      Contact Information Contact: Frédérique Mazerolle Organization: Media Relations, McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['accessibility', 'accessibility of computer system', 'Department of Art History & Communication Studies', 'Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Program.

"Expert: Proposed Rogers-Shaw deal bad for Canada, says Telus",26 Nov 2021,"Published: 26Nov2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      On November 22nd, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission began five days of public hearings into the proposed purchase of Shaw Communications by Rogers Communications. Telus says Rogers will be large enough to buy foreign content, such as TV shows and movies, which it will hold exclusively so other companies don’t have access to it. If Rogers can’t do so, it will raise rates or delay access to services in an effort to hamper competition, says Telus. (iPolitics) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Paul Beaumont, Assistant Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Canadians face some of the highest, if not the highest, prices for telecommunications services in the world. In this context, the CRTC is likely to be very sensitive to the potential price impact of the merger. This in turn will depend on the synergies realized by merging the two companies – for example, consolidation of broadcasting distribution services, deployment of the 5G network – but also on the extent to which new entrants will be able to compete in a market with three telecom giants.”  Paul Beaumont is an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Desautels Faculty of Management.

Expert: International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women | November 25 ,24 Nov 2021,"Published: 24Nov2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Every year, from November 25 (International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women) to December 10 (World Human Rights Day), Canadians observe the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence. It is an opportunity to come together to call out, speak up and renew our commitment to end gender-based violence. (Women and Gender Equality Canada)  Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue:  Shaheen Shariff, James McGill Professor, Department of Integrated Studies in Education   “While it is heartening to see substantial scholarship, political awareness and activism supporting the need to eliminate violence against women, it is disheartening that the stated intent of laws and policies against such violence are less efficiently implemented. Patriarchy, sexism, and misogyny continue to be deeply embedded in society. Violence against women and girls is increasingly enabled through social media platforms such as online sexual harassment; demeaning non-consensual distribution of intimate images that violate women and girls’ privacy and dignity; sex trafficking and normalized violence in pornography that young people can now freely access. We also saw a rise in domestic and sexual violence by intimate partners during the pandemic internationally. We have a lot of work to do globally and collectively, and I am grateful that the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women will raise increased awareness and hopefully resources, to support women whose lives are devastated because of senseless violence.”   Shaheen Shariff is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education and an Associate Member of the Faculty of Law. Her work is centred on the intersection of education, law and policy, with a focus on constitutional, human rights and civil law as it impacts educational institutions. She is best known for her work on cyberbullying, and sexual violence as symptoms of deeply ingrained systemic discrimination and societal power imbalances (intersecting forms of sexism, misogyny, homophobia, ableism, ageism, and xenophobia).  shaheen.shariff [at] mcgill.ca (English)     Contact Information Contact: Frédérique Mazerolle Organization: Media Relations, McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Department of Integrated Studies in Education', 'domestic violence', 'External', 'Faculty of Education', 'gender based violence', 'International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women', 'McGill experts', 'Shaheen Shariff', 'violence against women and girls']"
Experts: COP 26 United Nations Climate Change Conference ,1 Nov 2021,"Published: 1Nov2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be hosted by the United Kingdom, in partnership with Italy. The summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC. More than 190 world leaders will participate, along with tens of thousands of negotiators, government representatives, businesses and citizens for twelve days of talks. (United Nations) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Christopher Barrington-Leigh, Associate Professor, Institute for Health and Social Policy and Bieler School of Environment  “International negotiations should stop trying to legislate temperature or concentration and should instead focus on pricing carbon emissions. Not only are price agreements immediately actionable and visible but implementing prices domestically in developing economies would lead to a flood of profitable and beneficial foreign direct investment.”  Chris Barrington-Leigh is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Institute for Health and Social Policy and the Bieler School of Environment and an Associate Member in the Department of Economics. His research makes use of subjective well-being reports to address the relative importance of social and community-oriented aspects of life as compared with material consumption. chris.barrington-leigh [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Dror Etzion, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Yet again, we are told that a COP meeting is ‘our last chance’ to maintain a safe climate. The longer we wait, the more ambitious our efforts must be. COP 26 must now initiate bold action like shutting down some fossil fuel extraction, investing massively in renewable energy, developing local economic hubs, and shutting off the flow of money from the financial industry to Big Oil. We have waited far too long, and we have left ourselves no wiggle room.”  Dror Etzion is an Associate Professor of Strategy and Organizations at the Desautels Faculty of Management and an Associate Member of the Bieler School of the Environment. His work suggests that managing for sustainability through local, open, emergent initiatives increases the recruitment of diverse stakeholders, fosters creativity, and yields impactful outcomes. dror.etzion [at] mcgill.ca (English, Hebrew) Blane Harvey, Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar, Department of Integrated Studies in Education  “Like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the current state of the climate crisis represents a failure of both equity and ambition. If we are to see meaningful steps towards a better future for our children and grandchildren, rich countries like Canada must take transformative action at home and abroad, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. This calls for increased investment into global cooperation, collective learning, and making space in both research and policy for the voices of people at the frontlines of this global challenge.”  Blane Harvey is an Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar in the Department of Integrated Studies and an Associate Member of the Bieler School of Environment. As an interdisciplinary scholar who works across the social and natural sciences, her research pertains to how climate change knowledge is produced, validated and communicated, and how facilitated learning and knowledge sharing can support action on climate change. blane.harvey [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Stephanie Leite, PhD Student, Department of Integrated Studies in Education  “Youth have been pushing the conversation on climate action for years, through protests, strikes, and political lobbying—even before Greta Thunberg became a household name. School systems have been slow to respond to young people's growing concern about the state of the planet, but education can be a transformative force in these times of climate change. Instead of treating climate change as an add-on topic, educational institutions must engage learners in the modes of thinking needed to address this complex challenge and create space for youth to reimagine what it means to live in a climate-altered world.”  Stephanie Leite is a PhD student in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education. Her research interests include education for global citizenship, sustainable development, and climate change, with a focus on how the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be used to help define 21st-century learning. stephanie.leite [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English) Chandra Madramootoo, James McGill Professor, Department of Bioresource Engineering   “There is an urgency at the COP 26 to have governments go beyond making commitments to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to actually implement programs across all economic sectors that will actually halt rising global temperatures and sequester larger amounts of carbon in our soils and terrestrial landscapes. Drought, heat stress, forest fires, extreme weather events and sea level rise are severely affecting the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions in the developing world. This is driving large vulnerable populations further into poverty, food insecurity, and forced migrations. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all member countries of the UN, is now in jeopardy of being achieved.”  Chandra Madramootoo is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Bioresource Engineering, where he leads the Water Innovation Lab. His areas of expertise include water management, irrigation, drainage, agricultural research and development, development of innovative technologies to predict crop water requirements, and impacts of water management practices on greenhouse gas emissions. chandra.madramootoo [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Nigel Roulet, James McGill Professor and Chair, Department of Geography  “Though there is much excitement around the summit, I am not particularly optimistic that much will be accomplished. There will be many discussions and new or renewed agreements , but will they result in concrete actions? Neither government officials nor individuals take the problem of climate change seriously enough to significantly reduce our carbon footprint. This view may be pessimistic, but the evidence that we are taking the necessary steps is lacking.”  Nigel Roulet is a James McGill Professor of Biogeosciences and the Chair of the Department of Geography.

While her testimony echoed much of what she told the U.S. Senate earlier this month, her appearance drew intense interest from a British parliamentary committee that is much further along in drawing up legislation to crack down on social platforms. (CTV News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Taylor Owen, Associate Professor, Max Bell School of Public Policy and Beaverbrook Chair in Media, Ethics and Communications  “Frances Haugen has finally focused our conversation on the right problem: corporate decisions, product design, and incentive structures, that too often prioritize profit and growth over public safety and democratic responsibility. Instead of starting with the outcome of this structural problem – harmful speech – she rightly calls for governments to focus on ensuring greater accountability and transparency over the companies that shape it.

Experts: Inflation at almost two-decade high complicates Bank of Canada rate plan ,27 Oct 2021,"Published: 27Oct2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The cost of just about everything in Canada was more expensive in September, pushing headline inflation to its highest in almost two decades and complicating the Bank of Canada’s plans to keep interest rates pinned near zero until well into 2022. Prices are being driven higher around the world by an extreme mismatch between supply and demand. Suppliers are now scrambling to catch up, clogging ports and other transportation lanes that are dealing with their own pandemic-related issues. (Financial Post)  Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue:  John Gradek, Faculty Lecturer, School of Continuing Studies   “When images of empty store shelves and container ships in queues off major ports become ubiquitous, something is definitely amiss in supply chain design and execution. To better understand the root causes of these unsettling and persistent glimpses of chaos, one must examine the purchasing behavior of the consumer and the subsequent production and transportation decisions of suppliers and retailers as we try to predict an end to shortages. Will there be an end to this, or will supply chains require a reimagining to reflect consumers’ new buying habits?”   John Gradek is a Faculty Lecturer in the School of Continuing Studies, where he coordinates the Supply Chain and Operations Management and Integrated Aviation Management programs. He has held senior roles at Air Canada in operations, marketing and planning and has worked in the development and the delivery of commercial airline management programs for the International Aviation Management Training Institute. He is currently an adjudicator with the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada.  john.gradek [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)  Saibal Ray, James McGill Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management and Academic Director, Bensadoun School of Retail Management  “Supply chain problems and their impact have taken over the news cycle as the ‘pandemic news’ wanes. However, it is important to understand the underlying reason for this phenomenon, what are the short-medium term implications and what are the long-term solutions (if any). Especially important is to think about the pros and cons of shorter and perhaps local supply chains and how companies can manage supply chain associated risks.”  Saibal Ray is a James McGill Professor of Operations Management at the Desautels Faculty of Management and the Academic Director of the Bensadoun School of Retail Management.

Anita Anand becomes only the second woman in Canadian history to take on the role of Defence minister and Mélanie Joly received a major promotion this morning, moving up from minister of Economic Development and Official Languages to a much higher profile as Foreign Affairs minister. Canada will also be getting a new Environment and Climate Change minister, long-time environmental activist Steven Guilbeault just days ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow. (CBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “The new Liberal cabinet features major changes, notably the appointments of Steven Guilbeault as Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Mélanie Joly as Minister of Foreign Affairs. While Quebec is once again very well represented in cabinet, the nomination of Randy Boissonnault as Minister of Tourism marks the return of Alberta to the cabinet table. The results of the 2021 federal elections proved strikingly similar to the results of the 2019 federal elections, but this Liberal cabinet is quite different from the one appointed after those elections.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and a James McGill Professor in the Department of Political Science.

The social media giant said the disruption to network traffic ""had a cascading effect on the way our data centres communicate, bringing our services to a halt."" It said there is no evidence that user data was comprised. It was the largest such outage ever tracked by the web monitoring group Downdetector, which collates complaints about web outages. (CBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Samuel Veissière, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Co-director, Culture, Mind and Brain Program  “The global disruptions caused by the social media outage show us how vulnerable and dependent on a single corporate monopoly our social, professional, and economic life have become. Research is increasingly clear on the subject: despite the gains in connectivity and access to information, social media is overwhelmingly detrimental to our mental health and social relations.

Expert: Amazon faces Teamsters union drive at Canadian warehouse,27 Sep 2021,"Published: 27Sep2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Amazon.com Inc. could be facing its first unionization battle in Canada after a Teamsters local filed for a union vote for workers at the e-commerce giant’s fulfilment centre near Edmonton. If the Alberta Labour Relations Board verifies application, all workers at the YEG 1 fulfilment centre in Nisku, Alberta, who were employed as of September 13 will be able to vote on joining the union. In order to have a union vote filing approved in Alberta, the union must demonstrate 40 per cent of workers at a given job site have signed a petition for union representation. (Financial Post) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “Given Amazon’s extensively documented workplace abuses, it makes sense that Amazon workers are pushing back. Meanwhile, unions correctly see Amazon as an existential threat, and are trying to rise to the challenge. The organizing campaign at the Nisku warehouse outside Edmonton would represent a breakthrough for unions in North America, which could spur more organizing. It also will provide a test of how much labour laws matter for organizing anti-union companies like Amazon. Labour law in Alberta protects workers’ right to unionize much more than laws in the U.S., where employers are free to engage in scorched earth campaigns to block workers from unionizing. Winning the Nisku union election will still be challenging, but the rules will likely prevent Amazon from engaging in the type of behaviour we saw in Alabama earlier this year.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology.

Expert: Strength of a party's climate change plan could help influence federal election results,17 Sep 2021,"Published: 17Sep2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Climate change is a hot-button issue in this federal campaign, and data shows that a party’s environmental strategy could help influence its results in at least 9 ridings where races were neck-and-neck in the last election. Environics Analytics analyzed all 338 Canada’s federal electoral districts and found environmental issues are important to a wide swath of Canadians. The data and analytics firm found that voters in 46 ridings had above average concerns – compared to the national average – for the way their lifestyles have an impact on the world around them. (CTV News) Here is expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Christopher Ross, MA student, Department of Political Science  ""Since 2015, Canada has made considerable progress regarding climate change. This election, all major federal parties have converged on some form of carbon pricing as a core tool to meet their emission reduction targets. The Liberals plan to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The NDP would increase this target to 50%, while the Conservatives would return to the original Paris Agreement target of a 30% cut in emissions. The emerging government on Sept 21st will need to present their target at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow this November, an important milestone to keep average global temperature rise below 1.5 - 2 °C. Climate change has not seen the same coverage this campaign as compared to 2019, which might be a result of the Conservatives' more credible approach towards carbon pricing.

Expert: Sikh-Canadians to play an integral part to Canadian election outcome,15 Sep 2021,"Published: 15Sep2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has emerged as the most likable of the federal party leaders as Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau’s popularity sinks amid the election campaign, a new poll suggests. The Ipsos poll conducted exclusively for Global News found Singh was the only party leader who was viewed more positively than negatively, with 45 per cent approval versus 39 per cent disapproval among those surveyed. (Global News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Rupinder Liddar, PhD Student, Department of Political Science  “We might assume that Jagmeet Singh’s popularity is coming from the Sikh-Canadian community. However, with the NDP’s unsuccessful run in 2019, as well as anecdotal knowledge, it leads me to conclude that the Sikh community’s voting patterns vary based on characteristics ranging from socioeconomic status to country of birth and province/territory of residence, as well as other historical and generational factors. Additionally, given the record number of Sikh-Canadian MPs who were elected from the Liberal Party in 2015, it is clear that party affiliation and community mobilization are also significant factors.

Expert: Main federal parties all say they'll make housing more affordable,15 Sep 2021,"Published: 15Sep2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Canadian voters will be hearing a similar message from each of the major federal parties during the current election campaign: housing has grown too expensive, and we have a plan to fix it. The consensus reflects the increasingly dire state of housing in Canada, experts say, which affects everyone from prospective homeowners feeling squeezed out of the market to lower-income families languishing on waiting lists for affordable housing. (CBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Avi Friedman, Full Professor, Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture  “The increasing costs of materials, labour, land and infrastructure have created an affordability challenge for an estimated 1.6 million Canadians who are first-time home buyers. In 2021, Canada saw a change in housing affordability in 10 metropolitan areas. For example, in the past 10 years, Montreal home prices increased by 43%. In some regions, people spend up to 70 percent of their gross annual income on rental or owned dwellings way over the recommended 30 percent. The three main parties who promise to invest in affordable housing fail to realize that to achieve affordability there are many other aspects of housing that must be addressed. These include creating denser communities, and building smaller dwellings, adaptable units, and multi-generational housing. The money promised must be tied to other changes which are currently under the control of provinces and cities.”  Avi Friedman is a Full Professor at the Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture. His research interests focus on factors which influence the design and implementation of affordable and sustainable building practices at the unit and community levels, including market acceptance, construction, and resource efficiency. avi.friedman [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Frédérique Mazerolle Organization: Media Relations, McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['affordable housing', 'Avi Friedman', 'Canadian housing market', 'Canadian politics', 'External', 'federal election', 'housing markets', 'McGill experts', 'Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture', 'real estate']"
Expert: Record number of Indigenous candidates running in federal election,8 Sep 2021,"Published: 8Sep2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      A record number of Indigenous candidates are running in the federal election this year with what they say is a goal of advancing meaningful change in Canada's relationship with First Nations, Inuit and Metis. The Canadian Press analyzed party websites, as well as reached out to each party, to determine how many Indigenous candidates are hoping to get elected in Canada's 338 ridings on Sept. 20. The analysis determined there are at least 77 candidates this year compared with 62 in 2019. (CTV News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Chadwick Cowie, Faculty Lecturer, Department of Political Science  ""The 44th election is unique when it comes to Indigenous voices, as it marks the greatest number of Indigenous candidates (over 70 have self-declared) in Canada's federal electoral history. That said, a vast majority of these candidates are either running against one another (for instance in Nunavut) or will be seeking electoral outcomes in districts that their party has little chance of winning. Furthermore, it is imperative, when discussing Indigenous participation in Canadian electoral politics to consider whether they 1) will have a seat at the decision table; 2) will be forced to follow party lines; 3) will be supported by Indigenous peoples, especially those from their own communities and/or nation and/or confederacy; and 4) that ‘Indigenous’ is a blanket term that reflects over 50 different nations and confederacies which share territory with the Canadian state/in which Canada is situated upon.”  Chadwick Cowie is a Faculty Lecturer in the Department of Political Science, specializing in Indigenous, Canadian, and comparative politics.

Prior talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government on a political understanding that could lead to a peace deal, backed by the United States and its allies, have failed to make significant progress. (CBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Safia Amiry, PhD candidate, Department of Integrated Studies in Education   “As an Afghan woman who grew up under the extreme oppression of the first Taliban regime, I was horrified to see the scenes unfolding in Kabul and throughout Afghanistan this week. The withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from the country have left many Afghan nationals struggling for survival and fearing for their basic human rights. This is especially true for our women and girls who will no longer have the opportunity to go to school and who will suffer immensely under Taliban rule. Western and other nations must step forward to assist the Afghan people, those trying to flee and, most importantly, those who cannot.”  Safia Amiry is a PhD candidate in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education and a research assistant for Define the Line, a McGill-led research collective that addresses sexual violence, gender-based violence, and cyberbullying in classrooms, on university campuses, and in society at large.

Experts: Forest fires and smog,28 Jul 2021,"Published: 28Jul2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      More than 130 forest fires were burning in northwestern Ontario on Sunday, July 25, with Environment Canada issuing air quality statements for much of the region due to smoke. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Mohammad Reza Alizadeh, PhD candidate, Department of Bioresource Engineering  “Climate change is pushing fire behavior to levels that were hard to imagine they would reach and quickly. Climate warming is enabling normally wet forests to burn, and as wildfires move to higher ground, more forest area is now at risk.”   Mohammad Reza Alizadeh is a PhD candidate in the Department of Bioresource Engineering working under the supervision of Professor Jan Adamowski. His principal research objective is to bridge the gap between hydrology, climatology, remote sensing, and machine learning, towards addressing critical global water and environmental resource issues. His research interests extend to compound climate extremes and natural hazards, drought and flood analysis, human-climate interactions, and hydrological forecasting. mohammadreza.alizadeh [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English) Parisa Ariya, James McGill Professor, Departments of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Chemistry   “Climate change affects air quality and at the same time air pollutants, such as some greenhouse gases, are the main drivers of climate change. Summer smog in cities is formed predominantly via photochemical processes involving gases and particles. However, processes such as forest fire, medium- and long-term transport of particles such as dust and other local anthropogenic sources, can further alter the intensity and duration of smog. Poor air quality is known to have adverse impacts in several areas such as human health, ecosystem processes, and the reduction of visibility in the cities.”   Parisa Ariya is a James McGill Professor cross-appointed to the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Chemistry. A world leader in the study of bioaerosol transmission, her research explores major fundamental and applied research questions on chemical and physical processes involving aerosols (including air and waterborne viruses), as well as gaseous organic and trace metal pollutants of relevance to the Earth's atmosphere and to human health.  parisa.ariya [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)  Jill Baumgartner, Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar, Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Occupational Health and Institute for Health and Social Policy  “The biggest health threat from wildfire smoke is from very small microscopic particles that can penetrate deep into your lungs and can cause a wide range of health problems, from less serious ones like burning eyes and a runny nose to very serious chronic heart and lung diseases. In fact, thousands of Canadians die every year from exposure to air pollution from sources that wildfire smoke.”  Jill Baumgartner is an Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar cross-appointed to the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Occupational Health and the Institute for Health and Social Policy.

Experts: Ottawa tested facial recognition on millions of travellers at Toronto’s Pearson airport,22 Jul 2021,"Published: 22Jul2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The federal government quietly tested facial recognition technology on millions of unsuspecting travellers at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport in 2016. The six-month initiative, meant to pick out people the Canada Border Services Agency suspected might try to enter the country using fake identification, is detailed in a document obtained by The Globe and Mail through a freedom of information request. The project is the largest known government deployment of the technology in Canada to date. (Globe and Mail) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Ignacio Cofone, Assistant Professor and Norton Rose Fulbright Faculty Scholar, Faculty of Law  “Facial recognition is inescapable, invisible, and ubiquitous, making it the most invasive surveillance mechanism ever invented. Although airports are already high-surveillance spaces where people should have low expectations of privacy, implementing facial recognition implies a significant departure from current practices. It should only be implemented if there is a certainty that a significant security payoff exists to compensate for its risks, and that the measure is not simply part of a security theater.”  Ignacio Cofone is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law, where he teaches artificial intelligence law, business associations and privacy law. His research explores how the law should adapt to technological and social change with a focus on privacy and algorithmic decision-making. In his latest projects, he proposes how to evaluate harm in privacy class actions and how to prevent algorithmic discrimination. ignacio.cofone [at] mcgill.ca (English, Spanish) Benjamin Fung, Full Professor, School of Information Studies  “The question here is how to achieve a balance between national security and personal privacy. One should ask what additional information the CBSA can get via this new artificial intelligence program compared to the traditional immigration and customs procedure. It is important to note that the CBSA keeps an entry record of every visitor and has access to pictures of some visitors even without the facial recognition system. Thus, the only piece of new information that the CBSA can get from this system is the live facial pictures of travelers. If the CBSA only uses the pictures for a specific purpose and then permanently discards the pictures within a short period of time, then the privacy risk is low. This could be a good balance between national security and personal privacy.”  Benjamin Fung is a Full Professor in the School of Information Studies and holds the Canada Research Chair in Data Mining for Cybersecurity. He has over 90 refereed publications that span the research areas of data mining, privacy protection, cyberforensics, services computing, and building engineering. ben.fung [at] mcgill.ca (English) Sonja Solomun, PhD candidate, Department of Art History & Communications and Research Director, Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy   “Facial recognition seduces governments into deploying a technology that has been repeatedly proven to discriminate and into believing that national security is a worthwhile tradeoff for individual privacy. This misses the mark: the deployment of facial recognition in public is a collective harm because it exacerbates the power imbalance between those deploying it and those most vulnerable to its use. These are fundamental threats to democracy.”  Sonja Solomun is a PhD candidate in the Department of Art History & Communications Studies and serves as the Research Director of the Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy at the Max Bell School of Public Policy.

During a news conference at the Canadian Museum of History, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the Queen has accepted his recommendation to appoint Simon — a past president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national Inuit organization — as the 30th governor general. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “Mary Simon, the first Indigenous Governor General, is a highly qualified person for the position. This is especially the case because of her experience as an ambassador, which prepares her well for the ceremonial component of her role, and as a constitutional negotiator, which gives her in-depth knowledge of the constitutional order she will soon become a part of.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and a James McGill Professor in the Department of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Chadwick Cowie, Faculty Lecturer, Department of Political Science  “The appointment of Mary Simon to the role of Governor General of Canada is a monumental moment in not only Indigenous and Canadian relations, but more specifically Inuit and Canadian relations. Simon, who was born and raised in her territory of Nunavik, speaks both English and  Inuktitut and, while in the role of Governor General, most likely will also become the first trilingual speaker of three important and distinct languages within the Canadian state. Simon's appointment makes her the first Inuk to fill such a role, and second Indigenous female in the British Commonwealth – joining New Zealand's incoming Governor General Cindy Kiro, who is Maori.”  Chadwick Cowie is a Faculty Lecturer in the Department of Political Science, specializing in Indigenous, Canadian, and comparative politics.

"Expert: Bank of Canada should start issuing digital currency, experts say",23 Jun 2021,"Published: 23Jun2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Some technologists are telling the Bank of Canada (BoC) that its wait-and-see approach when it comes to issuing digital currencies runs the risk of leaving it behind in the race to innovate globally. Although its Governor Tiff Macklem said in April that the pandemic has accelerated the digital economy and “the case for a digital currency becomes more compelling,” the central bank says it has no immediate plans to launch a digital loonie. (Global News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Katrin Tinn, Assistant Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management   “With the proliferation of crypto-moneys, central banks may still be best positioned to provide a cash-like digital currency to the public, as an alternative to digital and physical cash. The BoC has taken up the challenge of thinking ahead of how such a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would look like, should there be a political decision to launch one in the future. It could arguably be more aligned with common social objectives, such as preserving privacy where it matters, avoiding the exclusion of less wealthy individuals, and providing an infrastructure for innovation and more efficient financial contracts.”  Katrin Tinn is an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Desautels Faculty of Management, where she focuses on applied theory in financial economics and information economics. In collaboration with Christophe Dubach, Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, she submitted a proposal to the Model X Challenge, a project seeking new designs and business models from North American institutions for the CBDC, which was selected as part of the three top projects by the BoC. katrin.tinn [at] mcgill.ca (English)    Contact Information Contact: Frédérique Mazerolle Organization: Media Relations, McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['bank of canada', 'cryptocurrency', 'Desautels Faculty of Management', 'digital currency', 'External', 'Katrin Tinn', 'McGill experts']"
Experts: Indigenous initiatives at McGill University,23 Jun 2021,"Published: 23Jun2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget     Image by Alex Fradkin.  In June, we commemorate National Indigenous History Month 2021 to recognize the history, heritage and diversity of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples in Canada. Here are some experts from McGill that can provide comment on initiatives that are transforming relationships with Indigenous communities across the country. These initiatives grow out of a series of 52 Calls to Action that McGill established as part of its own efforts towards recognition and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Gault Nature Reserve partners with the Grand Conseil de la Nation Waban-Aki Sharing a common interest in the protection of the natural and cultural resources of the Gault Nature Reserve, McGill University and the Grand Conseil de la Nation Waban-Aki announced a partnership agreement welcoming the Nation’s members to the site to practice their cultural activities. Christopher Manfredi, Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic)  “This is another step along the path to honouring the past and reconciling the future. A long road remains ahead of us, but we are committed to engaging and collaborating with Indigenous partners to identify, explore and advance plans that benefit our whole society by embedding Indigenous traditions in the life and activities of the University.”   Ashukin program Ashukin is a Naskapi word meaning “bridge”. The program connects McGill Nursing students with Quebec Indigenous populations in urban, rural and remote communities. Françoise Filion, Assistant Professor, Ingram School of Nursing and Co-Chair, Global & Indigenous Health Nursing  “We are creating a real, tangible connection between two communities, learning from and helping each other. The program provides students with the opportunity to work with Indigenous populations in both Southern and Northern Quebec, in urban, rural and remote communities.”  Rooted Rooted is a multi-media publication on Indigenous law at McGill run by the Indigenous Law Association. Larissa Parker and Sarah Nixon, Co-Executive Editors, Rooted  ""Rooted represents a conscious attempt to create space for Indigenous legalities, knowledge, and perspectives. Our contributors – academics, activists, artists, and leaders – offer insight into Indigenous legal orders and ways of being and knowing beyond the dominant liberal paradigm.”  Inuit traditional knowledge in the contemporary world A roundtable organized by Professor Marianne Stenbaek explores historical and contemporary Inuit cultural practices, with more than a dozen diverse presenters and panelists sharing their knowledge, research and experiences. Marianne Stenbaek, Full Professor of Cultural Studies, Department of English  “I have a passion for the Arctic and its peoples which inspire me and inform all my work. Relationships are pivotal to this type of work, so I’m incredibly thankful to have so many wonderful collaborators from different walks of life on board.”  McGill students and Kahnawà:ke team up to improve literacy To contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools were temporarily closed, interrupting the education of children everywhere. In Quebec, elementary schools in Kahnawà:ke and students from McGill University teamed up once again to strengthen reading skills so no student is left behind. Sophie Vaillancourt, Assistant Professor (Professional) and Coordinator of Clinical Education, School of Communication Sciences and Disorders  “The collaboration between the Kahnawà:ke Education Centre and the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders has been incredibly valuable to the learning of our graduate students. We want to thank the Kanien’kehá:ka for their continuous support and their ongoing openness to share their knowledge with our students.”   McGill Engineering youth outreach initiative A project led by Richard Chromik, Faye Siluk, and Robert Pozeg of the Faculty of Engineering’s E-IDEA initiative makes learning science more inclusive for Indigenous youth, with the help of the NSERC PromoScience grants program. Richard Chromik, Full Professor and Chair, Department of Mining and Materials Engineering  “Our program understands that it is important for science educators to be able to recognize and integrate students’ experiences, helping them to self-identify as innovative makers and creators.

Tuesday night's decision follows a difficult few weeks for the party, which has been ripped apart by internal disputes over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (CBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “In the latest federal elections, the Green Party won three seats in the House of Commons for the first time in history. Less than two years later, things don’t look so good, as the party’s marred with internal divisions over issues unrelated to the environmental mandate of the party such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With one of the three Green MPs crossing the floor to join the Liberals, Green leader Annamie Paul is now facing an outright revolt less than a year after assuming office.

Experts: U.S. seeking $25M from Air Canada for being slow to refund customers,15 Jun 2021,"Published: 15Jun2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The U.S. Department of Transportation is seeking a $25.5 million US penalty against Air Canada for ""failing to provide consumers prompt refunds"" after cancelling their flights amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In a ""notice of enforcement proceeding"" issued by the department on Tuesday, June 15, the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection says Air Canada ""unlawfully failed to provide timely refunds"" for flights between the United States and Canada that were cancelled or significantly changed. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: John Gradek, Faculty Lecturer, School of Continuing Studies  “The issue of Air Canada refunds has been the subject of a steady stream of dialogue and debate among travellers, the airline and the regulators of commercial air services. While the Canadian Transportation Agency has supported Air Canada’ issuance of vouchers and coupons rather than refunds since the start of service suspensions in March 2020, foreign regulators have been more forceful in demanding refunds for passengers whose cancelled trips involved their territory. The European Union has been largely successful in pressuring Air Canada to refund, and this action by the U.S. Department of Transportation is the result of their frustration at Air Canada’s lack of urgency in providing refunds.”  John Gradek is a Faculty Lecturer in the School of Continuing Studies, where he is also the program coordinator for the Diploma in Integrated Aviation Management. He has held senior roles at Air Canada in operations, marketing and planning and has worked in the development and the delivery of commercial airline management programs for the International Aviation Management Training Institute. He is currently an adjudicator with the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada. john.gradek [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Karl Moore, Associate Professor, Desautels School of Management  “The U.S. Department of Transportation has received, more than 6,000 refund complaints since March 1, 2020. It believes that Air Canada’s approach ‘lacks merit’. Air Canada, suffering the worst times in airline history, has worked very hard to preserve their cash flow. My sense is that the U.S. Department of Transport is more apt to prevail.”  Karl Moore is an Associate Professor of Strategy and Organization at the Desautels Faculty of Management.

Experts: FDA approves much-debated Alzheimer's drug panned by experts,10 Jun 2021,"Published: 10Jun2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      U.S. government health officials approved the first new drug for Alzheimer's disease in nearly 20 years, disregarding warnings from independent advisers that the much-debated treatment hasn't been shown to help slow the brain-destroying disease. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it granted approval to the drug from Biogen based on results that seemed “reasonably likely” to benefit Alzheimer's patients. (CTV News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Simon Ducharme, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “As the first FDA-approved disease-modifying drug in Alzheimer’s disease, this is a very positive step. However, the excitement is tempered by the questions that remain about the true extent of the efficacy of aducanumab given the discrepancy between the two major studies. A follow-up study will be required to confirm the clinical benefits and keep the FDA approval. If approved in Quebec, while it may present a significant challenge for the healthcare system for various reasons, it finally brings much needed hope for patients suffering from this devastating disease.”  Simon Ducharme is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry. His research uses advanced structural brain imaging techniques to study the longitudinal changes in brain development from childhood to old age, and how it impacts behavior across health and psychopathology. simon.ducharme [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Maiya Geddes, Assistant Professor, Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery   ""It is our job as clinicians to provide patients with evidence-based care. The FDA's decision to approve this drug is surprising, given the inconclusive data supporting its clinical effectiveness. Clinicians and hospital systems in the U.S. will have to scramble to fill the gaps left by the FDA, including defining important criteria for treatment, such as contraindications, stage of disease, and the need for Alzheimer's biomarker data.""  Maiya Geddes is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery and a clinician-scientist at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital. Her research aims to determine the brain mechanisms underlying the interaction between motivation and cognition in aging. She is currently leading a team of clinicians working on remote assessment of cognition in cognitively impaired adults. maiya.geddes [at] mcgill.ca (English) Jonathan Kimmelman, James McGill Professor, Department of Social Studies of Medicine and Director, Biomedical Ethics Unit  “For decades, the FDA has been a beacon for how policy-makers can join science to regulation to improve patient access to life saving drugs. This decision, which overruled independent scientific advice sought by the agency, suggests that beacon is now extinguished. Strong FDA regulations, combined with intellectual property protections, provide powerful incentives for companies to develop drugs and prove they are safe and effective. This decision sends a clear signal to pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms that they do not need to worry so much about the efficacy part.”  Jonathan Kimmelman is a James McGill Professor in the Biomedical Ethics Unit and Department of Social Studies of Medicine. His research centers on the ethical, social, and policy challenges in testing novel medical technologies in human beings (""translational clinical research""). Current projects are investigating risk, prediction, validity and knowledge value across the trajectory of drug development. jonathan.kimmelman [at] mcgill.ca (English) Gerhard Multhaup, Full Professor and Chair, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics   “As a long-term Alzheimer’s researcher, it is fascinating to see that the FDA, after nearly two decades, has approved the first treatment targeting the associated disease pathology. The drug developed by Biogen, an anti-amyloid antibody called aducanumab (Aduhelm), effectively reduces amyloid deposits in the brain. Such amyloid removal will likely lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients who are diagnosed at early stages of the disease. As the socioeconomic impact for patients and their caregivers continues to rapidly escalate world-wide, I expect that the FDA approval will inspire more investments in Alzheimer’s research to deliver improved diagnostics and treatments in the near future.”  Gerhard Multhaup is a Full Professor and the Chair of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. He is a world-renowned Alzheimer’s disease researcher, mainly known for his pioneering work that has advanced our mechanistic understanding of Alzheimer’s disease at the molecular level. gerhard.multhaup [at] mcgill.ca (English, German) Vasavan Nair, Full Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “This new treatment, while not a cure, is significant as is it the first approved drug that modifies one of the biological contributors to Alzheimer’s disease. It is important to acknowledge that it slows progression in a limited population of mild cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer’s and dementia. It does not stop the decline or improve cognition, but it represents an important step and progress in Alzheimer’s disease science.”  Vasavan Nair is a Ful Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Medical Director of the Moe Levin Memory Clinic at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute. The focus of his research is on the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in the preclinical, prodromal and early clinical stages, using new pharmacological (e.g. drug trials), and non-pharmacological (e.g. yoga and meditation) tools. vasavan.nair [at] douglas.mcgill.ca (English) Judes Poirier, Full Professor, Department of Psychiatry   ""The effect of this drug on memory remains quite modest. It should be noted that the FDA has conditionally accepted the drug to proceed with a third study, which will have to clearly demonstrate efficacy and benefit for the patient.""  Judes Poirier is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Director of the Molecular Neurobiology Unit at the Douglas Research Centre. He has made key contributions to the advancement of scientific research on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and is internationally renowned for his works on the role of apolipoprotein E in the normal and injured brain and in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. judes.poirier [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Frédérique Mazerolle Organization: Media Relations Office, McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"[""Alzheimer's"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Biomedical Ethics', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics', 'Department of Psychiatry', 'department of social studies of medicine', 'Douglas Research Centre', 'External', 'Gerhard Multhaup', 'Jonathan Kimmelman', 'Judes Poirier', 'McGill experts', 'molecular neuroscience', 'Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI)', 'Simon Ducharme', 'Vasavan Nair']"
Experts: Pride Month | June 2021,8 Jun 2021,"Published: 8Jun2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      June is Pride Month in Canada. It is a time when we celebrate diversity and LGBTQ+ communities, acknowledge their history, the hardships they have endured, and the progress that has been made. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Antoine Damiens, Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of English and Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies   “Pride is a riot, a celebration of queer resilience, and an homage to the creativity of LGBTQ+ folks. It is the perfect occasion to not only fight against discrimination and violence, but also to reflect upon the contributions of trans, racialized, indigenous community members – who have always been at the forefront of our collective histories.”  Antoine Damiens is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of English and the Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies. His research focuses on the history of queer cinema and the politics of queer cultural organizing. antoine.damiens [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English, French) Nate Fuks, Assistant Professor, Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology   “It is not uncommon to hear community members say that Pride celebrations are becoming obsolete as the LGBTQ+ community in Canada has been enjoying the equal rights and freedoms for many years. While it is true that the community has made huge strides in its fight for equality and acceptance, the fight is far from being over. It is important to remember that the community is not homogenous but rather diverse. As a result, a lot of oppressive patterns and hierarchies are still often represented within it, where members get discriminated against based on their race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, body type, and socio-economic status. Furthermore, Pride celebrations build awareness and solidarity with queer people in the countries where being LGBTQ+ is still illegal and punishable by death penalty, and this will continue to be instrumental in the fight for human rights until such atrocities cease to exist.”  Nate Fuks is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology, where he serves as the Director of the McGill Psychoeducational and Counselling Clinic. His recent research revolves mostly around intersecting identities and mental health of LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and refugees. nate.fuks [at] mcgill.ca (English) Richard Montoro, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry   “Accepting one’s authentic self is an important element in everyone’s mental health. Pride Month bolsters the dignity and self-respect of the LGBTQ+ community against the homophobia and transphobia that try to shame us.”  Richard Montoro is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the co-director of the McGill University Sexual Identity Centre. His expertise is in ER and LGBTQ+ psychiatry. richard.montoro [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Pierre-Paul Tellier, Associate Professor, Department of Family Medicine   “Pride is a time to recognize and celebrate those individuals who helped us gain the rights that we currently enjoy. It is an opportunity for our community to be seen as one, united and proud of who we are, so that members of the community, for instance young people who may feel like they are alone in their struggle, can start to feel more confident in themselves and move out from under the dark cloud that is self-doubt. We stand together as a force against hatred, prejudice, and biases, protecting each other from physical and emotional harm. Nonetheless, we must expect and demand respect from our fellow citizens and others throughout the world.”  Pierre-Paul Tellier is an Associate Professor in the Department of Family Medicine and served as the Director of Student Health at McGill University for more than 30 years before stepping down in 2015. An expert in adolescent medicine and LGBTQ+ health issues, he is the co-convener of a new special interest group on adolescent health for the World Organization of Family Doctors. pierre-paul.tellier [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Alanna Thain, Associate Professor, Department of English   “Pride is at its best when it remembers its political and activist roots.”  Alanna Thain is an Associate Professor in the Department of English and the director of the Moving Image Research Laboratory.

Expert: World Food Safety Day | June 7,7 Jun 2021,"Published: 7Jun2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   World Food Safety Day (WFSD) celebrated on 7 June 2021 aims to draw attention and inspire action to help prevent, detect and manage foodborne risks, contributing to food security, human health, economic prosperity, agriculture, market access, tourism and sustainable development. This year’s theme, ‘Safe food today for a healthy tomorrow’, stresses that production and consumption of safe food has immediate and long-term benefits for people, the planet and the economy. (WHO) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Stéphane Bayen, Associate Professor, Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry Professor Stephane Bayen has been working for 5 years to develop techniques to identify adulterated food products - particularly in honey.  ""Some of the fraudulent products that go into foods such as honey and spices have the potential to cause adverse health consequences for consumers. Substitution, adulteration or mislabeling create a breach in our food safety system. Illegal dyes or industrial chemicals have been shown to enter our food supply chain as adulterants. Consumers may thus be exposed to doses of toxic chemicals (pesticides, metals) or allergens through fraudulent products.""  Stéphane Bayen is an Associate Professor in the Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry. His research interests include (i) analytical chemistry applied to the detection of trace contaminants and their metabolites in food and the environment, (ii) the fate of contaminants (contaminant chemistry; bioaccumulation mechanisms involved in the contamination of foodstuff; behavior of contaminants during food storage, processing and cooking) and (iii) ecological & human health risk assessments. stephane.bayen [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Katherine Gombay Organization: Media Relations Office, McGill University Email: katherine.gombay [at] mcgill.ca Mobile Phone: (514) 717-2289",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry', 'External', 'Faculty of Agricultural and Environment', 'Stephane Bayen', 'World Food Security Day']"
Experts: Remains of 215 children found buried at a former residential school,31 May 2021,"Published: 31May2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Preliminary findings from a survey of the grounds at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School have uncovered the remains of 215 children buried at the site in British Columbia. In a statement, the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation explained they hired a specialist in ground-penetrating radar to carry out the work, and that their language and culture department oversaw the project to ensure it was done in a culturally appropriate and respectful way. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Richard Budgell, Professor of Practice, Department of Family Medicine  “There is a straight line between the discovery of 215 children’s bodies at the site of a former Indian residential school, and the treatment of Joyce Echaquan: both are signs of the persistence of systemic racism. Canadians and Quebecers need to confront our past with honesty before we can really make a better future where Indigenous peoples are treated fairly.”  Richard Budgell (Labrador Inuit) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Family Medicine, where he recently spearheaded a course to help doctors and researchers understand Inuit perspectives on healthcare. He worked for the government of Canada for 30 years until June 2020, most recently as the Quebec regional executive director of First Nations and Inuit Health. richard.budgell [at] mcgill.ca (English) Wanda Gabriel, Assistant Professor, School of Social Work  “The damage of residential school keeps on revealing just how cruel and inhumane the treatment of our children was and continues to be. Canada's child welfare continues to harm our little ones and our children are still being forced into a world and culture that is not ours. Since 1996, starting with the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, several commissions have uncovered the damage and destruction done to Indigenous peoples. Out these reports have come close to 800 calls to action for individuals and the state – how many have been completed? When will more actions occur to stop genocide and further destruction?”  Wanda Gabriel is an Assistant Professor in the School of Social Work and a member of the Kanieke’ha:ke nation. She has worked closely with the National, Regional Indigenous agencies and Indigenous communities across Canada dealing with crisis intervention and issues of sexual abuse, lateral violence, internalized oppression, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence and residential school issues. wanda.gabriel [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Frédérique Mazerolle Organization: Media Relations, McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Department of Family Medicine', 'External', 'indigenous children', 'Indigenous health', 'McGill experts', 'residential schools', 'Richard Budgell', 'School of Social Work', 'Truth and Reconciliation', 'Wanda Gabriel']"

In a video posted online, the detained blogger, Roman Protasevich, 26, said he was in good health, being held in a pretrial detention facility in Minsk, and acknowledged having played a role in organizing mass disturbances in the capital last year. The comments were immediately dismissed by his allies, including his father, as having been made under duress. (Global News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Maria Popova, Associate Professor and Jean Monnet Chair, Department of Political Science   “Like Russia, Belarus is inching towards more hard-line authoritarianism. The Lukashenka regime is using harsher and more systematic repression and flouting international norms more openly than ever before.”  Maria Popova is an Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science, where she holds the Jean Monnet Chair.

Experts: International Day for Biological Diversity | May 22 ,19 May 2021,"Published: 19May2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      As the global community is called to re-examine our relationship to the natural world, one thing is certain: despite all our technological advances, humans are completely dependent on healthy and vibrant ecosystems for water, food, medicines, clothes, fuel, shelter, and energy, just to name a few. The 2021 theme, “We’re part of the solution”, was chosen to be a continuation of the momentum generated last year under the over-arching theme, “Our solutions are in nature”, which served as a reminder that biodiversity remains the answer to several sustainable development challenges. (United Nations) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Andrew Gonzalez, Full Professor, Department of Biology  “2021 is a crucial year for addressing the biodiversity crisis. New global biodiversity goals will be set by the Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming, China, this Fall. This is our chance to set ambitious but realizable targets aimed at protecting nature, in all its forms, and the many essential benefits our society and economy derive from healthy ecosystems.”  Andrew Gonzalez is a Full Professor in the Department of Biology, where he holds the Liber Ero Chair in Conservation Biology. His research is broadly focused on the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss and the stability and functioning of ecosystems. andrew.gonzalez [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Brian Leung, Associate Professor, Department of Biology   “Biodiversity patterns are more nuanced than typically presented. Based on available time-series data, some regions appear to be at very high risk, such as in the Indo-Pacific, while other regions are actually showing general improvement, such as Europe. However, there's a lot of uncertainty because data simply do not exist for most species.”  Brian Leung is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biology and the Director of the McGill-STRI Neotropical Environment Option. He holds the UNESCO Chair for Dialogues on Sustainability and his expertise includes biological invasions, ecology of diseases and anthropogenic stressors. brian.leung2 [at] mcgill.ca (English) Laura Pollock, Assistant Professor, Department of Biology  “There’s never been a time with so much interest in protecting biological diversity. We have ambitious international commitments such as the 30 by 30 initiative (protecting 30% of land and ocean by 2030) and proposals to plant billions of trees. We’re also armed with more knowledge than ever, not only on threats, but on where to focus to efficiently protect biodiversity. Now is the time to put this knowledge to action.”  Laura Pollock is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology. Her research aims understand how and why biodiversity is distributed across the landscape using predictive modelling that draws from a range of subfields (macro-ecology, community ecology, biogeography and phylo-geography) and data sources (traits, phylogenies, experts). laura.pollock [at] mcgill.ca (English) Anthony Ricciardi, Full Professor, Bieler School of Environment and Redpath Museum  “One of the greatest threats to native biodiversity is biological invasion – the spread of plants, animals, and microbes beyond their natural range. Under human influence, species are spreading faster, farther, and in greater numbers than at any time in Earth's history – and thus constitute a unique form of global change. In particular, freshwater ecosystems are being transformed by the combined stressors of climate change and invasion.”  Anthony Ricciardi is a Full Professor cross-appointed to the Bieler School of Environment and the Redpath Museum and an Associate Member of the Department of Biology.

Bill 96 aims to “reinforce” French as the “common language” in the Quebec nation and seeks to change the Canadian Constitution to ensure that French is recognized as the only official language of the province. (Global News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Weinstock, Full Professor, Faculty of Law and Chair, Katharine A. Pearson Chair in Civil Society and Public Policy  ""The Bill presents a vast array of measures of different kinds, some of them quite administrative and technical, and others much more far-reaching. The three that will likely be the focus of debate are, first, the ‘wall-to-wall’ application of the notwithstanding clause for the second time (after its use in Bill 21) to immunize the legislation against potential challenges grounded in considerations of individual rights; second, the proposed unilateral modification of the Constitution, affirming the status of Quebec as a nation and the status of French as the sole common language of the nation; and third, the narrowing of access to English CEGEPs. These three pose ethical, philosophical, constitutional and administrative issues which, I hope, will be thoroughly discussed as the Bill is debated in the National Assembly and in society at large"".

Experts: Escalating violence between Israelis and Palestinians,13 May 2021,"Published: 13May2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Israel hit three multi-storey towers as it hammered the Gaza Strip with airstrikes, and militants in the territory fired barrages of rockets at Israel, in the most severe outbreak of violence since the 2014 Gaza war, with no resolution in sight. The fighting has taken on many hallmarks of that devastating 50-day conflict between Israel and Hamas, but with a startling new factor: large, heated protests by Israeli Arabs in support of those living in the territories as well as counter-violence by Jewish Israelis. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Rex Brynen, Full Professor, Department of Political Science  “The current Israeli-Palestinian violence is not just the result of the legacies of the Trump Administration, rising tensions in Jerusalem, political deadlock in Israel, and the postponement of Palestinian elections. More fundamentally, it is the result of generations of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the complete absence of a political or diplomatic horizon and an increasingly permanent dynamic of repression that the Human Rights Watch is now explicitly likening to apartheid.”  Rex Brynen is a Full Professor in the Department of Political Science, specializing in politics, security, and development in the Middle East.

Experts: Scottish National Party promise independence referendum after election win ,11 May 2021,"Published: 11May2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The Scottish National Party is promising to hold a second independence referendum after election results announced Saturday saw pro-independence candidates gain a majority in the Scottish parliament. In her victory speech, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her party, which wants to break away from the United Kingdom, had delivered a ""historic and extraordinary"" win after finishing with 64 seats in the Scottish parliament, one short of a majority. (CNN) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: British politics Brian Cowan, Associate Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “The one thing that the UK and Scottish governments can agree upon is that there won't be a referendum until after the COVID-19 crisis has been settled. This gives both sides time to negotiate a compromise.”  Brian Cowan is an Associate Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies and holds the Canada Research Chair in Early Modern British History. He studies the social and cultural history of ideas in early modern Britain and Europe. brian.cowan2 [at] mcgill.ca (English) John A. Hall, Emeritus James McGill Professor, Department of Sociology   “The triumph of the Scottish Nationalist Party in the latest elections suggest that a new referendum is likely. However, though there may be pressure, interests in Scotland as much as in Westminster make this outcome unlikely.”  John A. Hall is an Emeritus James McGill Professor in the Department of Sociology and currently a Visiting Professor in the School of Social and Political Science at the University of Edinburgh. A world-renowned historical and macro-sociologist, his research focuses on market ideologies, state theories, nationalism and globalism. john.a.hall [at] mcgill.ca (English) Quebec politics Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “While Scotland might be heading towards a second independence referendum is less than a decade, support for sovereignty in Quebec remains comparatively low and the traditional vehicle for the cause, the Parti Québécois, is facing a clear decline. Although it could certainly boost the morale of sovereigntists, a successful independence referendum in Scotland would be unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the political situation in Quebec.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and a James McGill Professor in the Department of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Daniel Weinstock, Full Professor, Faculty of Law and Chair, Katharine A. Pearson Chair in Civil Society and Public Policy  “The political and constitutional relevance of the Scottish election for Quebec and Canada is limited. Politically, parties advocating for Scottish independence are on the ascendant, whereas in Quebec they now represent somewhere on the order of 25-30% of the electorate, and a much smaller proportion of the seats in the National Assembly. There has not in recent years in the Canadian context been the kind of blockbuster political event of the magnitude of Brexit that might trigger a political resurgence of the independence option. Constitutionally, the Secession Reference creates a framework in Canada within which the question of secession is to be handled, whereas part of what is at stake in Scotland right now is precisely that the right of Scots to determine their constitutional future be recognized, that the exercise of that right not be determined exclusively by London. All that being said, there is no predicting the impact that an eventual successful Scottish referendum might have on public opinion in Quebec. Despite the obvious differences, it may very well, if it were to happen, capture the imagination of many Quebecers.”  Daniel Weinstock is a Full Professor in the Faculty of Law, where he holds the Katharine A.

Expert: Facebook board upholds Donald Trump suspension,10 May 2021,"Published: 10May2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Former U.S. President Donald Trump won't return to Facebook – at least not yet. Four months after Facebook suspended Trump's accounts for inciting violence that led to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the company's quasi-independent oversight board upheld the bans. But it told Facebook to specify how long they would last, saying that its ""indefinite"" ban on the former president was unreasonable. The ruling, which gives Facebook six months to comply, effectively postpones any possible Trump reinstatement and puts the onus for that decision squarely back on the company. (CTV News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Jason Opal, Associate Professor and Chair, Department of History and Classical Studies  “The Facebook Oversight Board's decision will certainly anger the roughly 35% of Americans who remain Trump loyalists and will probably stoke broader conservative anger over 'cancel culture.' However, the decision is a matter of commonsense in light of the ongoing criminal investigations over the 6 January attack on the Capitol.

Experts: Laurent Commission on Children's Rights and Youth Protection,4 May 2021,"Published: 4May2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Quebec is being called on to turn ""anger into action"" in a landmark report into the province's youth protection services, two years after the death of a seven-year-old girl in Granby shocked the public and raised questions about the system. The report, released on May 3, calls for a wide range of changes, including increased funding for preventive programs aimed at helping children in distress, an independent commissioner to oversee the youth projection system and a charter of children's rights. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Cindy Blackstock, Full Professor, School of Social Work  “I was pleased to testify at the Laurent Commission on the relationship between the ongoing cross-cutting inequalities in First Nations public services and the over-representation of First Nations children in care. I also highlighted how litigation via the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is helping to remedy some of those inequalities and why implementation of recommendations in the Viens Commission and those tabled by the First Nations for Quebec and Labrador Health and Social Services Commission were critical to remedying the over-representation.”  Cindy Blackstock is a Full Professor in the School of Social Work and the Executive Director of First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada. A member of the Gitksan First Nation with 25 years of social work experience in child protection and indigenous children’s rights, her research interests include Indigenous theory and the identification and remediation of structural inequalities affecting First Nations children, youth and families. cindy.blackstock [at] mcgill.ca (English) Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Assistant Professor, School of Social Work  “The Laurent Commission Report hits several marks but misses the one for Black children who have been overrepresented in Quebec’s child welfare system for 40 years. The failure to acknowledge the reality of systemic racism while simultaneously reducing Black experiences of social injustice to individual challenges of ‘adaptation’ and ‘acculturation’ is at the root of the problem. Ignoring this reality perpetuates the historic legacy of racism against Black children, their families, and communities.”  Alicia Boatswain-Kyte is an Assistant Professor in the School of Social Work. With over ten years of clinical experience working with marginalized individuals, families and groups, her research interests center around the systemic oppression of racialized individuals and how this contributes to their unequal representation within systems of social control. alicia.kyte [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Frederique Mazerolle Organization: Media Relations Office, McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Alicia Boatswain-Kyte', 'child care', 'child protection', 'children rights', 'Cindy Blackstock', 'External', 'McGill experts', 'School of Social Work', 'youth protection centres']"
Expert: Affordable housing crisis in Quebec ,3 May 2021,"Published: 3May2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Premier François Legault says he recognizes there is a shortage of affordable housing in Quebec but says his comments that a person can rent an apartment in Montreal for between $500-$600 a month have been misinterpreted. A survey published by La Presse last weekend revealed the average price of a Montreal apartment is about $907 a month and often these units are in terrible shape. (Montreal Gazette) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Avi Friedman, Full Professor, Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture  “Cities need to be creative when zoning places.

Experts: Apple users can say no to being tracked with new software update,29 Apr 2021,"Published: 29Apr2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Apple rolled out a software update for its mobile devices that gives users the option of stopping apps from tracking their location and sharing other identifying information with third parties. Services such as Facebook and others currently have the ability to track users on mobile devices in order to learn more about them to target advertisements and other location-based services to them. In some instances, the tracking is in place even if the user is not actively using the app in question. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Ignacio Cofone, Assistant Professor and Norton Rose Fulbright Faculty Scholar, Faculty of Law  “By requiring apps to ask for permission to track users outside of the app, the new iOS 14.5 tracking transparency feature may sound simple, but it has huge consequences. It gets a step closer to de-bundling consent, meaning that users can choose over different options instead of having a single ‘take it or leave it’ choice from app developers. More importantly, the choice is significant because the back-end data sharing among apps that users can now prevent thanks to this feature will reduce privacy risks.   Ignacio Cofone is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law, where he teaches artificial intelligence law, business associations and privacy law. His research explores how the law should adapt to technological and social change with a focus on privacy and algorithmic decision-making. In his latest projects, he proposes how to evaluate harm in privacy class actions and how to prevent algorithmic discrimination. ignacio.cofone [at] mcgill.ca (English, Spanish) Grant McKenzie, Assistant Professor, Department of Geography  “Apple has taken a significant step in the direction of preserving user privacy, one that is long overdue in the tech industry. While the App Tracking Transparency feature does not change much from a technical perspective, it does empower Apple users by making them aware of tracking data and giving them a choice.”  Grant McKenzie is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography, where he leads the Platial Analysis Lab, an interdisciplinary research group that works at the intersection of information science and behavioral geography. Much of his work examines how human activity patterns vary within and between local regions and global communities. grant.mckenzie [at] mcgill.ca (English) Allen Mendelsohn, Sessional Lecturer, Faculty of Law  “By requiring an opt-in for sharing of certain information with third parties, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature is the beginning of a transformation of the existing paradigm for consumer privacy. At the same time, businesses will most likely suffer from less effective advertising and thus a reduced bottom line.”  Allen Mendelsohn is a Sessional Lecturer at the Faculty of Law, where he teaches a course on Internet Law. He is a Montreal-based independent practitioner specializing in internet and technology law. allen.mendelsohn [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Renee Sieber, Associate Professor, Department of Geography and Bieler School of Environment  “Apple's privacy policy should be seen primarily to concentrate ad revenue in Apple's ecosystem. We should focus on privacy violations within the platform. For example, through its own mobile location tracking or the use of Apple News, the company can find out a lot about its consumers and can monetize that information throughout its apps.”  Renee Sieber is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Department of Geography and the Bieler School of Environment and an Affiliated Member of the School of Computer Science.

Experts: World Intellectual Property Day | April 26,23 Apr 2021,"Published: 23Apr2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The World Intellectual Property Day shines a light on the critical role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the economy and how they can use intellectual property (IP) rights to build stronger, more competitive, and resilient businesses. (World International Property Organization) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Gabriella Coleman, Associate Professor, Department of Art History & Communication Studies  “The World Intellectual Property Day provides an opportune time to reflect on the pros and cons of national and international IP regimes. While patents, for instance, do spur innovation, they can also cost lives—as the current pandemic demonstrates. Intellectual property works best when it’s treated as one option among others. In some contexts, like a pandemic, compulsory licensing yields practical and moral benefits that outweigh the traditional monopolies afforded by patents. More so, we now have decades of alternatives schemes, largely in the open source, open science, and right to repair movements, that allow us to tangibly assess which model, for what purpose, and what time works best and for what purpose.”  Gabriella Coleman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Art History & Communication Studies, where she holds the Wolfe Chair in Scientific and Technological Literacy. Trained as a cultural anthropologist, she conducts research on computer hackers and digital activism. gabriella.coleman [at] mcgill.ca (English) Richard Gold, James McGill Professor, Faculty of Law  “There are two interrelated stories about the COVID-19 pandemic that relate to intellectual property. It was by using IP that firms, such as Moderna and BioNTech, developed the platform on which they created their vaccines. It is also IP that stands in the way of developing countries being able to manufacture and sell vaccines, increasing the opportunity for the rise of new and more deadly variants. We must recognize both these aspects of IP and find ways to decrease the harms while drawing on the strengths. More sharing, more focused IP, and more collaboration form part of the solution.”  Richard Gold is a James McGill Professor and is the founding Director of the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy.

Expert: Quebec court upholds most of province’s secularism law,21 Apr 2021,"Published: 21Apr2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Quebec’s secularism law is largely legal, a Superior Court judge ruled on Tuesday, April 20, even as he acknowledged it violates the rights of Muslim women and has cruel and dehumanizing consequences for those who wear religious symbols. Justice Marc-André Blanchard upheld the bulk of the religious symbols law, while striking down clauses pertaining to English-language school boards and a ban on members of the provincial legislature wearing face coverings. (Global News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Pearl Eliadis, Affiliated Member, Max Bell School of Public Policy and Adjunct Professor, Faculty of Law  “The Court’s decision is a restrained and detailed analysis of the legal conventions in Canada’s constitutional structure. Although the court clearly felt that it was constrained by the use of the notwithstanding clause and rejected some of the novel arguments made by lawyers seeking to circumvent it, it did uphold the fundamental rights of minority linguistic communities and those of elected members to the National Assembly under the Canadian Charter. It is not a surprise that the Quebec government immediately indicated that it would appeal the decision.”  Pearl Eliadis is an Affiliated Member at the Max Bell School of Public Policy, as well as an Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Law.

Experts: Earth Day | April 22,20 Apr 2021,"Published: 20Apr2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Earth Day, celebrated annually on 22 April, will again see more than 1 billion people participating in activities around the world to draw attention to the urgency of the climate crisis and environmental degradation and the need for immediate action. Many important environmental events have happened on Earth Day since its inception in 1970, including the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2016. The theme for this year – the second Earth Day Live digital event - is: Restore our Earth. (United Nations) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Christopher Barrington-Leigh, Associate Professor, Institute for Health and Social Policy and Bieler School of Environment  “Earth Day should not be a day to explore guilt or fear, but rather a day to celebrate and dream. The world has turned a momentous corner and much has changed in Canada and elsewhere since April 22nd last year. This year, we should be spending Earth Day envisioning positive futures.”  Chris Barrington-Leigh is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Institute for Health and Social Policy and the Bieler School of Environment and an Associate Member in the Department of Economics. His research makes use of subjective well-being reports to address the relative importance of social and community-oriented aspects of life as compared with material consumption. chris.barrington-leigh [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Eric Galbraith, Full Professor, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences  “Over the past year, COVID-19 has taught us that life can change quite quickly – we are not so locked into a single way of living as we used to think. This Earth Day marks a special moment in history, where we can take the COVID-19 lesson of just how dramatic change can be and apply it – deliberately – to rebuilding society for sustainability and well-being.”  Eric Galbraith is a Full Professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. His current work aims for an integrative understanding of global sustainability problems, combining Earth system science approaches with simple representations of the global human system. eric.galbraith [at] mcgill.ca (English) Shaun Lovejoy, Full Professor, Department of Physics   “There are exciting new developments in climate modelling that can reduce the uncertainty in climate projections for 2050. There is room for optimism internationally, with the United States recommitting to the Paris Climate Agreement and China committing to being carbon neutral by 2060. However, the current climate situation is alarming in both Quebec and Canada. Provincially, the CAQ government plans to fund only 40% of the mitigation measures needed to bring us to our already inadequate 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets. As for Canada, the federal government is more concerned with propping up the oil industry (+ 15 billion dollars in subsidies in the last year) than in transitioning to renewable energy sources.”  Shaun Lovejoy is a Full Professor in the Department of Physics, where he specializes in atmospheric dynamics and climate predictions and modelling.

The Liberals’ first budget in two years outlined the government’s plans for a national child-care system, including what strings will be attached to any spending. There were also measures to boost the supply of affordable housing and money aimed at greening the economy as the Liberals look to chart a path for promises on climate change. (Global News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Childcare Tina Montreuil, Assistant Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology  “This federal budget’s investment in supporting families represents one of the most important policy advancement for Canadian women, children and the economy in a generation. This government initiative will assist families in seeking much needed affordable and accessible quality care for children and their family needs but will also mobilize the inception of a childcare system that will position Canada—provinces and territories—to emerge strongly from the pandemic and beyond. As stipulated by renowned economists, there are huge short and long terms benefits for a state and country to invest in early childhood development as research has determined that it reduces deficits and strengthens the economy. Such an investment by our government will not only support the development of children, but also the well-being of family, representing one of the biggest economic payoff for parents, children, and the economy overtime.”  Tina Montreuil is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology and an Associate Member of the Department of Psychiatry. Her research focuses on investigating the role of emotion regulation, attitudes, and beliefs on the development and intergenerational transmission of psychopathology and how symptoms of mental health problems might interfere with self-regulated learning in a group context and ultimately, educational achievement. tina.montreuil [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Housing  David Wachsmuth, Assistant Professor, School of Urban Planning  “As Canada begins to recover from the pandemic, the federal government has the responsibility to tackle the country’s escalating housing crisis through strong new investments in affordable rental housing.”  David Wachsmuth is an Assistant Professor at the School of Urban Planning, where conducts research on urban and regional governance, smart cities, and urban sustainability. He co-authored reports on the impact of Airbnb on Canadian housing markets, and more recently on the effects of short-term rentals in Halifax, Nova Scotia. david.wachsmuth [at] mcgill.ca (English) Policy and politics  Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “This is perhaps the most important federal budget in a generation. We have never witnessed a longer gap between two federal budgets since 1867. The stakes are very high for the government, as the budget will be followed by a confidence vote. Even if it survives the confidence vote, the Trudeau government is likely to use this budget as a key source of pledges for its next electoral platform, especially if federal elections take place later this year. But above and beyond party politics, this budget is an essential policy document for the country, as it outlines the priorities of the federal government while addressing key issues such as fiscal sustainability, economic recovery, social inequalities, and the fight against climate change.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and a James McGill Professor in the Department of Political Science.

According to Doctors of the World Canada, which runs a clinic for migrants in this category, Bill 83, which was introduced by the Minister of Health, creates new and unnecessary administrative procedures along with obstacles that stand in the way of it achieving the desired objectives. (Le Devoir) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Jill Hanley, Associate Professor, School of Social Work  “While Bill 83 makes an important contribution by covering all children born in Canada with RAMQ insurance, the procedures being proposed for children born outside of Canada remain complex and will present barriers.

Their efforts are brave given the tumultuous digital landscape and the emotional labor of activist work. But what they are doing is necessary if we want social change. In the school setting, we need to do better at talking with youth about sexual and gender-based violence through social justice-oriented, critical sexualities education lenses.

However, the pandemic has also revealed challenges that women faced through social isolation, lockdowns, and economic downturns. Domestic and sexual violence is reported to have increased, placing many women in precarious situations with fewer access to resources. To that end, our iMPACTS team is working consistently to inform and guide policy at federal, provincial and administrative levels, and provide resources through engagement and empowerment of graduate and undergraduate students in gender-based and social justice research.”  Shaheen Shariff is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education and an associate member of the Faculty of Law.

I was inspired by those few women who had broken that glass ceiling. I hope I can do the same for young women today, especially visible minorities. I want women to know that you can have a family and a fulfilling career. The key is believing in yourself and following your passions.”  Lucy Gilbert is a Full Professor cross-appointed to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Oncology and the Director of Gynecologic Oncology at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).

To resolve this seemingly intractable problem, we must interrogate how our societal understandings of gender can construct ideas about who should and should not be scientists, and the conditions these produce for women in male-dominated fields.”  Allison Gonsalves is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education. Her research program focuses on the area of gender and physics education research and investigates the role of science outreach in post-secondary students' identity work in STEM fields. allison.gonsalves [at] mcgill.ca (English) Valérie Orsat, Full Professor, Department of Bioresource Engineering   “The recognition of the leadership of women in their professional fields is important. In my own field of bioresource engineering, we attract a good number of female students (50 percent) that perform very well in their program, yet, once they graduate, the number of practicing women professional engineers drops down. The presence of women in academia is important as they are role models of success for young women.”  Valérie Orsat is a Full Professor in the Department of Bioresource Engineering. Her research program addresses the broad spectrum of quality changes that occur during various stages of postharvest handling and food and bio-processing. valerie.orsat [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Lisa Overholtzer, Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar, Department of Anthropology  “Although women had made great strides in their representation within both academic and professional archaeology before the COVID-19 pandemic began, parity had not yet been reached. In fact, in the past 15 years, women – especially those with Canadian degrees – have been hired into tenure-track positions at rates significantly lower than their representation among PhD recipients. Moreover, preliminary data across academia suggests that the pandemic is disproportionately impacting mothers and Black, Indigenous and faculty members of colour (BIPOC) and will exacerbate these existing inequalities.”  Lisa Overholtzer is an Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar in the Department of Anthropology, where she strives to bridge disciplinary chasms between archaeological theorists and scientists through the application of geoarchaeological and molecular archaeology analyses to research questions derived from social theories of materiality, agency and practice, and embodiment.

The metrics used by the United Nations (UN) to assess progress toward achieving gender equality are sometimes difficult to measure in wealthy nations like Canada. This means that, on a global scale, discussion of gender equality often focuses primarily on progress in low and middle-income countries. It is clear that wealthy nations, including Canada, have their own work to do to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.”  Alissa Koski is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health and an Associate Member of the Centre on Population Dynamics.

It is the structures and the ways work is organized that create and maintain inequality. Research on differences in workplace outcomes for men and women often focuses on differences between men and women. It is equally important to focus on how men and women are placed in different locations in the workplace and in different jobs.”  Lisa Cohen is an Associate Professor and Director of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion at the Desautels Faculty of Management. Prior to joining Desautels, she was a faculty member at the London Business School, the Yale School of Management and the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, where she taught in the areas of strategic human resources, organizational behavior, and communications. lisa.cohen2 [at] mcgill.ca (English) Melissa Sonberg, Professor of Practice, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Much has been written this past year on women being rather effective leaders in times of crisis. Whether effective crisis leadership is truly a ‘female attribute’ or a function of how girls and women learn to think about others before themselves is an interesting question. Perhaps, what we are seeing is that an ability to demonstrate empathy and act with the greater good in mind does achieve the best outcomes – and this should not be a ‘women-only’ competency.”  Melissa Sonberg has enjoyed over three decades of international leadership success across a broad range of corporate, not-for-profit, and academic environments.

Expert: Millions of Texans are still without power as winter storms continue,19 Feb 2021,"Published: 19Feb2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      A rare deep freeze in Texas that raised demand for power forced the U.S. state's electric grid operator on Monday to impose rotating blackouts that left nearly three million customers without electricity. The cold snap sweeping Texas reached the northern part of neighboring Mexico as well, where authorities said 4.7 million users lost power early on Monday, February 15. (CBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: François Bouffard, Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  “What is taking place in Texas is beyond a perfect storm; close to a full week of consecutive below freezing temperatures is unprecedented and was not even considered in wild worst case planning scenarios. Texas has a considerable capacity to generate and maintain energy supplies, but we need to recall that electricity demand in Texas peaks in summer. Electricity shortages were therefore inevitable, a problem that has been compounded by a stressed natural gas supply. Moreover, the situation is worsened by Texas’ electricity market structure which relies on short-term high price signals (with current prices in the range of $9000/MWh) to stimulate long term capacity investments. As a result, it is difficult to make sure its power generation capacity is adequate at all times.”  François Bouffard is an Associate Professor and a William Dawson Scholar in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Inc. under a series of strict terms and conditions the government says ""are in the interest of Canadians."" A statement released by the transport minister's office said the impact of COVID-19 was a key factor in the final decision to approve the purchase. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: John Gradek, Faculty Lecturer, School of Continuing Studies  “Consolidation in the Canadian airline industry has historically led to concentration of market and pricing power, reducing markets served and eliminating low fares. The conditions placed on the Canadian government’s approval of this purchase reflect their concern on these issues, but the implementation of such oversight remains a question mark.”  John Gradek is lecturing in the Diploma program in Integrated Aviation Management as well as in both the certificate and diploma programs of Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Operations Management.

(Government of Canada) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey, Assistant Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “Those who have power to exercise self-determination have power to control the writing and promotion of their history. Therefore, celebrating Black history and Black History Month is more than a perfunctory exercise that acknowledges Black people throughout the African Diaspora and Africa. Teaching, researching, and promoting the history of a globally subordinated and subjugated racial group is an innocuous yet profoundly revolutionary act of self-determination.”  Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies and a historian of post-Reconstruction United States, specializing on the African American experience. His research focuses on the intersections of the United States, Canada, and the African Diaspora. wendell.adjetey [at] mcgill.ca (English) Philip S. S. Howard, Assistant Professor, Department of Integrated Studies in Education  “Black History Month is an important opportunity for celebration, affirmation, and focused attention for Black communities doing the daily work of asserting our humanity. But it cannot and should not be allowed to take the place of meaningful and substantive attention to dismantling institutional anti-black racism.”  Philip S. S. Howard is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies. He works in the areas of critical race studies, anti-colonial studies, and antiblackness in education. His current research projects investigate contemporary Canadian blackface as a postracialist phenomenon, and Black people’s agency in educational contexts in Toronto, Halifax, and Montreal. philip.howard [at] mcgill.ca (English) Myrna Lashley, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “The celebrations and acknowledgement of the contributions of Black people to Canadian and Quebec history must go beyond Black History Month, as Black history is part of the Canadian and Quebec history – not a thing apart.

Last year, an independent consulting firm was hired by the Privy Council Office to review reports that Payette was responsible for workplace harassment at Rideau Hall. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “The resignation of Julie Payette is an unprecedented move that calls into question the judgement of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who appointed her without sufficient vetting. This resignation also exacerbates political uncertainty in the context of a minority parliament in which the governor general’s constitutional role is highly significant.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and James McGill Professor of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Patricia Faison Hewlin, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management   “During these uncertain and devastating times, we are in critical need of leaders who are skilled at connecting to people in meaningful ways—building unity, allaying concerns, and showing empathy. Leaders who have placed these skills on the lower end of their priorities are now finding themselves less able to lead effectively. The days are over when leaders could skimp on emotional intelligence and building relationships. Employees are demanding more from their leaders.”  Patricia Faison Hewlin is an Associate Professor of Organizational Behaviour at the Desautels Faculty of Management. She conducts research on how organization members and leaders engage in authentic expression, centering on employee silence, and the degree to which members suppress personal values and pretend to embrace those of the organization, a behavior she has termed as “creating facades of conformity”. patricia.hewlin [at] mcgill.ca (English) Brian Rubineau, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Former Governor-General Julie Payette has had an impressive career as an engineer, astronaut, and public advocate for women's involvement in STEM careers. However, such a career does not guarantee learning the skills needed to lead and manage a large governmental organization and to cultivate a productive and inclusive working environment for its members. To cultivate a productive work environment, managers need training, but they also need to go beyond that.. Learning the skills of good management is not enough – the skills and behaviors must be enacted to benefit the organization.”  Brian Rubineau is an Associate Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Desautels Faculty of Management.

The theme of the 3rd International Day of Education is ‘Recover and Revitalize Education for the COVID-19 Generation’. Now is the time to power education by stepping up collaboration and international solidarity to place education and lifelong learning at the center of the recovery. (UNESCO) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Future of education  Adam Dubé, Assistant Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology  “COVID-19 disrupted students’ education considerably while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of educational technologies. Technology adoption was done with little guidance and support and resulted in both help and harm. The future of education will be forever changed by this mass technology adoption; it is our responsibility to ensure the innovations we adopt fulfill the potential of every learner, regardless of circumstance.”  Adam Dubé is an Assistant Professor in the Learning Sciences Program of the Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology. He investigates how educational technology augments the learning process and teaches courses on the use of emerging educational technologies. adam.dube [at] mcgill.ca (English) Bronwen Low, Associate Professor, Department of Integrated Studies in Education  “The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened and exposed significant inequities in our education system. These include the digital divide and other social inequalities shaping and limiting remote learning; the differing vulnerabilities and needs of children of ‘remote’ vs ‘essential’ workers; and the ways that the overcrowded and poorly maintained public school buildings limit social distancing. We have also seen innovation and resilience from schools, teachers, communities, families, children and youth. Going forward, I’m interested in how what we are learning – and we still know very little about the pandemic’s impact on education – can help us refuse the ‘business of usual' model of education and imagine something new.”  Bronwen Low is an Associate Professor in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education. She is interested in how we might better support socially marginalized young people underserved by traditional schooling models and practices. bronwen.low [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Mental health and wellness Nancy Heath, James McGill Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology  “As we move towards a post-COVID-19 world, it is imperative that we integrate mental health and well-being curriculum into our education. The pandemic has taken a huge toll on our students' mental health and education cannot happen without mental health. We must revitalize education by prioritizing recovery education.”  Nancy Heath is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology. Her research program explores resilience and adaptive functioning in young people at-risk (children, adolescents, and young adults). nancy.heath [at] mcgill.ca (English) Steven Shaw, Associate Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology   “The COVID-19 pandemic is a disruption in education, community, health, friendships, and development for children and adolescents. The challenge is to create a foundation of safety and stability required for short- and long-term mental health and learning – balanced with opportunities created through innovation, creativity, and independence forced on schools and families by the pandemic.”  Steven Shaw is an Associate Professor in the Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology, where he serves as the director of the Resilience, Pediatric Psychology and Neurogenetic Connections Lab and the co-director of the McGill Developmental Research Lab. His research interests include pediatric school psychology, improving education for children with rare genetic disorders, improving implementation of innovation and clinical research in education and psychology, and developing resilience skills in children at risk for academic failure. steven.shaw [at] mcgill.ca (English) Physical activity and sports Gordon Bloom, Full Professor, Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education  “It is during the current pandemic, when there are fewer available organized sport opportunities for children, that physical and health education becomes more important for both the physical and psychological well-being of young people. Simply, young people need to move and remain active during this challenging time of our lives, and physical and health education classes can provide this much-needed outlet for young people.”  Gordon Bloom is a Full Professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education.

Biden signed an executive order rejoining the Paris climate accord within hours of taking the oath of office, fulfilling a campaign pledge. (CTV News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Christopher Barrington-Leigh, Associate Professor, Institute for Health and Social Policy and Bieler School of Environment  “California and Quebec’s current cap-and-trade agreement presents a truly remarkable situation and has extraordinary potential implications for ‘the tail wagging the dog’ when it comes to the next step of national policies and for coordination between Justin Trudeau and Joe Biden.”  Chris Barrington-Leigh is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Institute for Health and Social Policy and the Bieler School of Environment and an Associate Member in the Department of Economics. His research makes use of subjective well-being reports to address the relative importance of social and community-oriented aspects of life as compared with material consumption. chris.barrington-leigh [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Dror Etzion, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Former President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement required the international climate movement to expend considerable time and energy to highlight the folly of withdrawal, rather than simply working to reduce emissions. With President Joe Biden’s decision to rejoin, advocates for the climate can now channel their efforts to more meaningful activities. In that regard, it is worth noting that Biden signed an additional five climate related executive orders on his first day of office, some of which are much more material, immediate and tangible than rejoining the Paris Agreement. The real work, for President Biden and other world leaders, lies ahead.”  Dror Etzion is an Associate Professor of Strategy and Organizations at the Desautels Faculty of Management and an Associate Member of the Bieler School of the Environment. His work suggests that managing for sustainability through local, open, emergent initiatives increases the recruitment of diverse stakeholders, fosters creativity, and yields impactful outcomes. dror.etzion [at] mcgill.ca (English, Hebrew)    Contact Information Contact: Frederique Mazerolle Organization: McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['climate change policy', 'External', 'Joe Biden', 'McGill experts', 'paris climate agreement', 'sustainability', 'US politics']"
Experts: Joe Biden’s presidential inauguration,19 Jan 2021,"Published: 19Jan2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday under a pledge to ""heal"" the country as it grapples with an ongoing pandemic, economic uncertainty and deep political divisions. Extra security measures will be in place following the violence that erupted at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 as rioters sought to stop Congress from certifying the president-elect's win over Donald Trump. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “We cannot underestimate how significant the transition from the Trump to the Biden administration is for Canada. For instance, soon after inauguration, the Biden administration is likely to take rapid policy actions on key economic, public health, and environmental issues that are likely to have a direct impact on Canada. Some Canadians will applaud these decisions, but others are likely to oppose them.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and James McGill Professor of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “President-elect Biden has built his career by being a political weathervane and based on the proposals his transition team has unveiled so far, it looks like he feels the winds blowing to the left. His pandemic relief package could be bigger, but at least begins to address the magnitude of the crisis. Still, this should not obscure the fact that these measures mainly look good by comparison to the shambolic pandemic response of the Trump administration. They fall far short of what other countries have been able to implement.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology. As a comparative historical sociologist, his research explores the changing relationship between social mobilization, political processes, and ideology in advanced capitalist democracies. barry.eidlin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Shirley Cardenas Organization: Media Relations Office, McGill University Email: shirley.cardenas [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6751 Mobile Phone: (514) 594-6877",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['America', 'barry eidlin', 'Daniel Béland', 'External', 'Inauguration', 'Joe Biden', 'President', 'presidential', 'U.S.', 'United States']"
Expert: Canada continues to ‘make the case’ for Keystone XL to Joe Biden’s team,19 Jan 2021,"Published: 19Jan2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan says the government is continuing to “make the case” for the Keystone XL pipeline expansion despite reported plans from Joe Biden to immediately quash the project. His comments come on the heels of reports that Biden is planning to cancel the planned pipeline expansion as one of his first moves after becoming U.S. president. (Global News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “The advent of the Joe Biden administration and the presence of a double Democratic majority in Congress are likely to make things more difficult for the oil and gas industry, but also for provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan that rely on it economically and fiscally. This is the case because the Biden administration, while pushing for new measures to fight climate change, is also likely to adopt a much more critical stance than the Donald Trump administration towards pipeline projects that require a federal license. This situation may well have direct consequences for ongoing political debates about both pipeline building and environmental policy here in Canada.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and James McGill Professor of Political Science.

(BNN Bloomberg) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Maxime Cohen, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Government regulations amid the pandemic, such as lockdowns and curfews, often trigger a feeling of anxiety. Many customers translate this feeling into a panic-buying behavior by rushing to stores in order to stockpile on essential products.

Experts: Pro-Trump chaos on Capitol Hill,6 Jan 2021,"Published: 6Jan2021  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Last week pro-Trump protesters stormed the legislature as lawmakers were set to review the Electoral College votes that made Joe Biden the president. (Globe and Mail) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey, Assistant Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “Only white people in the United States have the inalienable right to resist perceived government tyranny. In other words, whiteness is in and of itself a monopoly on violence and the use thereof, which means the state cannot ever use violence to overwhelm white people, even during an insurrection. We’re witnessing the afterlife of the U.S. Civil War, the failure to break the resolve of the treasonous Confederacy, and the unmitigated racial terrorism to which white supremacists have ceremoniously subjected African Americans.”  Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies and a historian of post-Reconstruction United States, specializing on the African American experience. His research focuses on the intersections of the United States, Canada, and African Diaspora. wendell.adjetey [at] mcgill.ca(English) Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “This is a sad day for U.S. democracy, even as the clear victory of Joe Biden is certified by the U.S. Congress, as it should be. Canadians should pause and draw lessons from the current pathologies of U.S. democracy because Canada is not necessarily immune to them.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and James McGill Professor of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “The insurrection at the Capitol, while shocking, is not surprising. Trump’s refusal to concede defeat in the November election has created even more chaos within his party. While nobody in party leadership actually believes that Trump won, least of all Trump himself, he is using the ‘stolen election’ fiction as a loyalty test for elected officials, who must show their support for the outgoing president by denying reality.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology. As a comparative historical sociologist, his research explores the changing relationship between social mobilization, political processes, and ideology in advanced capitalist democracies. barry.eidlin [at] mcgill.ca(English, French) Mugambi Jouet, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Law   “This unrest crystallizes the growing polarization of the United States over a host of social, political, legal, religious, and racial issues. The polarization has old roots in distinctive aspects of American society, although it has intensified remarkably during the Trump presidency.”  Mugambi Jouet is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law. His research focuses on criminal justice and comparative government from a multidisciplinary perspective. He is an expert on the distinctive historical evolution of American law, institutions, and sociopolitical culture compared to other Western democracies such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European nations. mugambi.jouet [at] mcgill.ca (English, French, Spanish) Jason Opal, Associate Professor and Chair, Department of History and Classical Studies  “This is without precedent in the 231 plus years of the United States. The President directly incited an armed crowd to surge into the very center of the republic, with the intention of carrying out a coup d’état. We can only hope that the Capitol Hill police or National Guard can restore order and restart Congress without violence.”  Jason Opal is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classical Studies, where he teaches and writes about the U.S. Constitution in different periods of American history. His work tries to integrate social, cultural, and intellectual history and to shed light on such broad topics as nationalism, capitalism, democracy and U.S.-Canada foreign relations. jason.opal [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Debra Thompson, Associate Professor, Department of Political Science   “The only ones shocked and surprised that fallaciously aggrieved white people would have the gall to storm the US Capitol are other white people. This America – the America of threat and violence and the constant threat of violence – is the American that Black people know intimately. As the media focuses on the spectacle of the insurrection, we should not lose sight of the more than 70 million people, 58 percent of whom are white, that still voted for Trump last November. The danger isn’t just from vigilante insurrectionists – it’s far more ubiquitous than that.”  Debra Thompson is an Associate Professor in Department of Political Science and holds the Canada Research Chair in Racial Inequality in Democratic Societies.

Being mindful, acknowledging substance use triggers, staying connected to support networks, and reaching out for help are strategies that may help people cope with problematic substance use during these difficult times.”   Rachel Rabin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and a researcher at the Douglas Research Centre. Her research program focuses on developing a better understanding of the neurocognitive and social cognitive dysfunction in individuals with substance use disorders in both psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia) and non-psychiatric populations. rachel.rabin [at] mcgill.ca (English) Children and screen time Victoria Talwar, Full Professor and Chair, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology  “During the Holidays, when there will be more unstructured time the temptation to resort to screen time activities will increase for families with children. Limiting screen time is easier if parents plan and encourage other activities. This can include activities like playing games, baking, making a craft, or reading. It is important for the well-being of everyone, that families have quality time to interact with each other and to do things that are engaging and fun off-screen.”  Victoria Talwar is a Full Professor and the Chair of the Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology. She holds the Canada Research Chair in Forensic Developmental Psychology. Her research interests include children’s verbal deception, children’s moral development, theory-of-mind understanding and behaviour; children’s expressive display rule knowledge and behaviour. victoria.talwar [at] mcgill.ca (English) Exercise and staying active Gordon Bloom, Full Professor, Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education  “Many are experiencing a loss of motivation to exercise as sport programs and exercise facilities remain closed due to COVID-19. Although there are fewer choices in what we can do and where we can do it, we can overcome some of these barriers with creative thinking. For example, we can strengthen our body by focusing on flexibility or cardiovascular fitness training in our own homes. We can also do these workouts with friends, teammates or loved ones via online platforms, such as Skype or Zoom. Let’s challenge ourselves to overcome these barriers and continue to exercise and stay fit.”  Gordon Bloom is a Full Professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education. His research focuses on sport psychology, pedagogy, coaching knowledge and behaviours, team building, and psychology of athletic injuries such as concussions. gordon.bloom [at] mcgill.ca (English) Steven Grover, Full Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine  “During the social isolation surrounding the pandemic, there is increasing evidence of more stress, anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality, weight gain, and sedentary behaviour. Regular exercise has been consistently proven to be a highly effective therapy to both prevent and treat these health conditions. Accordingly, exercising daily is arguably among the most important treatments available to improve our physical and mental health during the pandemic, and all year long.”  Steven Grover is a Full Professor in the Department of Medicine and the Director of the Comprehensive Health Improvement Program. His research focuses on the importance of exercise, healthy eating, and other lifestyle interventions to improve health, as well as on digital, e-health interventions using web-based platforms. steven.grover [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Food and cooking Nathalie Cooke, Full Professor, Department of English   “Though the holiday season will look and feel a bit different to most due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this can also be a time to enjoy stay-at-home pleasures. In a time where people are seeking comfort and connection, turning to cooking and baking some of your favourite recipes may bring a feeling of happiness and nostalgia and hopefully create memorable moments with your loved ones.”  Nathalie Cooke is a Full Professor in the Department of English and the Associate Dean, Associate Dean, Rare & Special Collections, Osler, Art, and Archives, of the McGill Library. Her research focuses on the shaping of literary and culinary tastes and practices in Canada. nathalie.cooke [at] mcgill.ca (English) Giving back Eric Latimer, Full Professor, Department of Psychiatry   “The holiday season calls on us to be especially generous to people in need. Year after year, we give to charities that serve people experiencing homelessness. Yet, the number of such people is only increasing, in part because rents are rising faster than incomes at the bottom of the wage ladder. It does not have to be that way. By funding specialized teams to help people regain permanent housing, together with more affordable housing and more targeted prevention programs, we could get on track to reducing and eventually eliminating homelessness, as Finland is well on the way to accomplishing.”  Eric Latimer is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Director of the Mental Health and Society Research Program at the Douglas Research Centre. A health economist, his research interests focus on community-based supports for people with severe mental illness, particularly their economic aspects. eric.latimer [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Daiva Nielsen, Assistant Professor, School of Human Nutrition  “Experiences with food insecurity have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we approach the holiday season, it is important to remember that community support and resilience are more important than ever. Volunteer grocery shoppers in communities can play a crucial role in ensuring food access for community members who are unable to shop for groceries in stores. Consider helping out with a volunteer group in your community to ensure that daily life essentials and other needs can be met for the more vulnerable members of our communities.”  Daiva Nielsen is an Assistant Professor in the School of Human Nutrition. She is currently leading a study to compare household food procurement experiences across different regions in Quebec, including those more affected by COVID-19. daiva.nielsen [at] mcgill.ca (English) Holiday shopping Maxime Cohen, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “The 2020 holiday shopping season is one for the books. Retailers will need to double their creative efforts to attract both local customers to their physical stores and international customers to their online channel. This year more than ever, data analytics can be leveraged to extend personalized offers that can be a win-win for both retailers and customers.”  Maxime Cohen is an Associate Professor of Retail Management and Operations Management at the Desautels Faculty of Management and the Co-Director of the McGill Retail Innovation Lab. His core expertise lies at the intersection of data science and operations management. maxime.cohen [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Anwar White, Faculty Lecturer, Desautels Faculty of Management  ""Holiday shopping has been moving toward e-commerce more and more as the years go by – about 20% in 2019. Those numbers are expected to grow closer to a third. Just as retailers are having to transform and evolve the way they do business; customers are also changing their buying habits. You'll notice more participation with the pickup in store offering, in-store kiosks, and online buying from customers that had never done those things before.”  Anwar White is a Faculty Lecturer at the Desautels Faculty of Management. A veteran in the retail industry, he joined the Bensadoun School of Retail Management as the program director of the new Master of Management in Retailing in 2019. anwar.white [at] mcgill.ca (English)  Hospital visits and emergencies Zachary Levine, Associate Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine  “For mild health issues people should consider whether there are other good options like local clinics before making their way to the emergency room. However, they should not hesitate to go to the ER if they are experiencing symptoms that are worrisome or potentially life-threatening. During this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with mild symptoms should get tested and isolate at home. If they are experiencing symptoms of concern such as shortness of breath, they should go to the ER. If they are not sure they can call 811 to determine whether they need to go to the hospital as well as which one, as not all hospitals admit COVID-19 patients.”  Zachary Levine is an Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and an attending physician at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC). His areas of expertise include community outreach, geriatric emergency medicine and medical error prevention. zachary.levine [at] mcgill.ca (English) Isolation and loneliness  Joe Flanders, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology  “The Holidays are an important moment for us to take a break from the daily grind, connect with others and recharge our batteries. For some, the expectation that all of this can be achieved in a period packed with events and family gatherings is unrealistic and many can be left feeling disappointed, or worse. We are all feeling a little isolated and deprived these days and a small window to gather and connect seems woefully insufficient. That said, the restrictions will likely calm the typical frantic pace of the holiday season this year, which may mitigate some of the stress.”  Joe Flanders is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and the founder and director of the MindSpace Clinic, a Montreal-based full-service clinic promoting well-being in individuals, organizations, and communities. He offers Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy to individuals, groups, and organizations. joe.flanders [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)  Anna Weinberg, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology  “Stress is a risk factor for a huge range of health problems, including increases in anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 pandemic has many elements that make it a particularly potent stressor. However, not everyone is experiencing the pandemic in the same way, and different individuals are differentially susceptible to the effects of stress. It is critical to address both the unequal distribution of pandemic-related stress and to promote strategies that individuals can use to buffer against the adverse effects of stress.”  Anna Weinberg is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology. She holds the Canada Research Chair in Clinical Neuroscience. Her research focuses on identifying biological pathways that give rise to disordered emotional experience. anna.weinberg [at] mcgill.ca (English) New Year's resolutions and goals  Anne Holding, Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Psychology  “When you are selecting your goals, pay close attention to the language you are using. Is your goal something you ‘have to do’, ‘should be doing’ or ‘something you want to do’? Research suggests you will be much more successful at the goals you actually want to do rather than the goals you feel pressure and obliged to pursue. If you find you really do not want to work on your goal or that it simply feels too effortful and draining, consider adapting the goal to something you feel more excited about or letting go of the goal all together – maybe now is just not the right time for it.”  Anne Holding is a recent PhD graduate from the Department of Psychology, where she is now involved as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the McGill Human Motivation Lab. Her research looks at autonomous motivation, goal disengagement and motivational antecedents. anne.holding [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English) Richard Koestner, Full Professor, Department of Psychology  “To say the least, 2020 has been a year like no other. As it is coming to an end, we may be inclined to make more ambitious New Year resolutions to make up for what could be considered as ‘lost’ time. In normal times, 80% of people focus on personal achievement goals, like losing weight or improving fitness. In light of the isolating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be more beneficial for our well-being to instead focus on social goals in 2021, such as reconnecting with old friends – virtually at first, but in person after our vaccinations.”  Richard Koestner is a Full Professor in the Department of Psychology and the head of the McGill Human Motivation Lab. For more than 30 years, he has been conducting research on goal-setting, self-regulation and internalization processes. richard.koestner [at] mcgill.ca (English) Traveling during the Holidays  John Gradek, Faculty Lecturer, School of Continuing Studies  “The Canadian aviation industry is not alone in its positioning as it attempts to entice air travel during the holiday period. There are major marketing efforts to promote the hygiene of the aircraft experience, as well as the number of initiatives to provide arrivals COVID-19 testing at Toronto and Calgary airports on a trial basis. Canadian public health officials remain steadfast in their advice to only undertake essential travel, and that arrivals into Canada are obligated to complete a 14-day quarantine. The decision to travel this holiday period requires a very personal risk assessment of the entire experience and the health status of the traveler.”  John Gradek is lecturing in the Diploma program in Integrated Aviation Management as well as in both the certificate and diploma programs of Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Operations Management. He has held senior roles at Air Canada in operations, marketing and planning and has worked in the development and the delivery of commercial airline management programs for the International Aviation Management Training Institute. john.gradek [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Vincent Poirier, Assistant Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine  “When traveling, in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a real risk, which may be minimized by combining several mitigation strategies. These include mandatory masking onboard, minimizing unmasked time while eating, turning on gasper airflow while inflight, frequent hand sanitizing, disinfecting high touch surfaces, promoting distancing while boarding and deplaning and limiting onboard passenger movement. The implementation of a standardized digital health pass for COVID-19 and more robust contact tracing may be key factors to allow for a gradual safe return to sustainable and responsible travel.”  Vincent Poirier is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and a physician and aviation medicine specialist at the McGill University Health Centre. He is also the co-founder and director of the Onboard Medical Emergencies course that teaches health professionals how to manage inflight medical emergencies. His expertise has been sought after by major airlines, such as Air Canada and Air Transat, where he serves as a medical consultant on passenger health. vincent.poirier [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Wellness and spirituality Robert Whitley, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry  “COVID-19 restrictions have caused separation from the people, places, and social activities that give our lives purpose and meaning. This can cause loneliness. That said, there is a crucial difference between being alone and being lonely. Solitude can inspire renewal through reflection and introspection and can also give time for meaningful activities including meditation, prayer, exercise, writing, creative arts and other activities which can foster positive mental health. It does not have to be all doom and gloom.”  Rob Whitley is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Principal Investigator of the Social Psychiatry Research and Interest Group (SPRING) at the Douglas Research Centre.

In its 2020 National Cyber Threat Assessment, the agency warns that state-sponsored cyber activity is the most sophisticated and actors are “very likely” attempting to develop capabilities to disrupt critical systems; will “almost certainly” continue conducting commercial espionage against Canadian governments, businesses, and organizations. (CTV News) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Benjamin Fung, Full Professor, School of Information Studies  “The assessment report suggests that the foreign-state-sponsored actors may target critical Canadian organizations to collect information, pre-position for future activities, or as a form of intimidation. Yet, the general public, academics, and companies may not be able to differentiate which organizations or companies are sponsored by foreign states. A few days ago, an opposition motion was passed, forcing the Liberal government to devise a plan to counter foreign operations in Canada. The government should publish a list of foreign-state-sponsored organizations, so academics and companies can take that into consideration while choosing collaborators, receiving sponsorship, and co-applying research grants.”  Benjamin Fung is an Associate Professor in the School of Information Studies and an Associate Member of the School of Computer Science.

(CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Christopher Barrington-Leigh, Associate Professor, Institute for Health and Social Policy and Bieler School of Environment  “Anyone with an intermediate understanding of sustainability could tell you there are notable problems with this policy. Flashy targets and subsidies are the way Canada has effectively ignored climate for decades. In contrast, Quebec has the opportunity to put into place equitable, effective, and positively-oriented alternatives.""  Chris Barrington-Leigh is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Institute for Health and Social Policy and the Bieler School of Environment and an Associate Member in the Department of Economics. His research makes use of subjective well-being reports to address the relative importance of social and community-oriented aspects of life as compared with material consumption. chris.barrington-leigh [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Jeffrey Bergthorson, Associate Professor and Panda Faculty Scholar in Sustainable Engineering & Design, Department of Mechanical Engineering  “Our transition to a low-carbon society, powered by renewable electricity, will bring significant economic and environmental benefits for Québec and Canada. This low-carbon society requires carbon-free fuels for heavy duty transportation, remote power generation, and seasonal energy storage. We must look at all of the options, from hydrogen to ammonia to even using metals, including aluminum and iron, as recyclable fuels.”  Jeffrey Bergthorson is an Associate Professor and Panda Faculty Scholar in Sustainable Engineering & Design in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. His research program is aimed at the development and validation of models for the combustion properties of alternative and sustainable (bio-derived) fuels through a complementary experimental, computational, and analytical modeling approach. jeff.bergthorson [at] mcgill.ca (English) Kirk H. Bevan, Associate Professor, Department of Mining and Materials Engineering   “The plan is a good start, but it needs to be coupled with developing Quebec as an economic powerhouse in sustainable energy production and utilization (for example in technological exports), as well as taking a world leading role in all aspects of sustainable energy technology research and development. Ideally, our energy technology export industry should an equal powerhouse to our aerospace industry in 20 years. This is where the global economy is headed, and we need to be at the forefront.”  Kirk H. Bevan is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mining and Materials Engineering. His research focuses on computer-aided modelling, electronic materials, energy, nanomaterials and surface science. kirk.bevan [at] mcgill.ca (English) Sylvain Coulombe, Full Professor and Gerald Hatch Faculty Fellow, Department of Chemical Engineering   “Quebec’s green economy plan is a major step in the right direction. Perhaps not ambitious enough, but pragmatic and evolutive. The massive electrification of the economy should be seen and conveyed to Quebecers as an echo of the large hydroelectric projects of the 1960-1980 period. These projects mobilized and galvanized the entire province, made us proud, and created expertise and technologies that are exported across the globe.”  Sylvain Coulombe is a Full Professor and Gerald Hatch Faculty Fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Associate Vice-Principal, Innovation and Partnerships in the Office of the Vice-Principal (Research and Innovation). His research interests include the use of advanced materials for energy, electrical-to-chemical energy conversion, engineering for the circular economy and plasma engineering. sylvain.coulombe [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) George Demopoulos, Gerald Hatch Professor and Chair, Department of Mining and Materials Engineering   “The plan announced by the Government of Quebec seeks to balance the imperative of climate protection with a strong economy. It looks to capitalize on Quebec’s hydro power to become a green energy-driven economy. This accelerated move towards the electrification of transportation and the targeted development of the industrial sector of batteries is very timely and opportune. Green hydrogen provides another exciting prospect. Overall, the green plan works towards a sustainable economy with strong research and innovation capacity – the assured way forward for a prosperous advanced society.”  George Demopoulos is a Gerald Hatch Professor and Chair of the Department of Mining and Materials Engineering. His research focuses on hydrothermal processing of inorganic materials, comprising both hydrometallurgical processes and aqueous chemical processing of advanced materials. george.demopoulos [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Dror Etzion, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Quebec’s green economy plan is both narrow and uninspiring. It is narrow because it focuses primarily on transportation, virtually ignoring other greenhouse gas emitting sectors such as buildings, agriculture and manufacturing. It is uninspiring because it imagines a transportation future that is no better than our current one. A car-centric province with endless traffic jams, agonizing road-rage and sprawling development is dismal, and experiencing it through the windshield of an electric car is nowhere near enough to make it pleasant. It’s time to integrate efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with comprehensive, inspiring policy choices that will promote innovation and improve the quality of Quebecers’ lives.”  Dror Etzion is an Associate Professor of Strategy and Organizations at the Desautels Faculty of Management and an Associate Member of the Bieler School of the Environment. His work suggests that managing for sustainability through local, open, emergent initiatives increases the recruitment of diverse stakeholders, fosters creativity, and yields impactful outcomes. dror.etzion [at] mcgill.ca (English, Hebrew) Raynald Gauvin, Full Professor, Department of Mining and Materials Engineering   “Quebec has everything it needs to empower green energy. Moving towards electric vehicles will significantly reduce oil consumption in Quebec. We have all the necessary minerals to make lithium ion batteries used in electrical vehicles. Starting from the mines all the way to the battery factories in Quebec, we can create a strong green energy economy. Moreover, these batteries are needed to store electricity produced by solar cells and wind turbines, which will be important in countries where electricity is produced by coal or oil. Moving forward with a strong Quebec battery industry is clearly the way to go.”  Raynald Gauvin is a Full Professor in the Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, where he holds the Henry Birks Chair in Metallurgy. His research interest include developing new methods to characterize the microstructure of materials using high resolution scanning electron microscopy with x-ray microanalysis and Monte Carlo simulations. raynald.gauvin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French, Spanish) Sébastien Jodoin, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Law  “The latest plan for a green economy is a missed opportunity for Quebec. To do its part in the fight against climate change and respect the human rights of its citizens, Quebec must adopt more ambitious measures to initiate a faster transition to carbon-neutrality.”  Sébastien Jodoin is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law and an associate member of the Bieler School of Environment. He holds the Canada Research Chair (Tier 2) in Human Rights and the Environment. His research focuses on legal and policy solutions to complex environmental and social problems that cut across multiple fields and levels of governance. sebastien.jodoin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Nicolas Kosoy, Associate Professor, Department of Natural Resource Sciences   “Quebec’s 2030 Plan for a Green Economy focuses almost entirely on electrification and expansion of the electric grid to underserved communities, while it fails to address the so needed reduction in demand. Moreover, far away impacts of electrification such as pollution from lithium mining are not even considered. The province deserves an economic plan that ensures basic human needs for the long term and avoids technological fixes such as green hydrogen. This only reinforces the idea that we can constantly grow our energy supply, as if tapping renewable energy sources produce no impact environmentally and socially.”  Nicolas Kosoy is an Associate Professor in the Department of Natural Resource Sciences. His current research focuses on the interface of climate, energy and land-use governance, including the analysis of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), as well as alternative economic models and plural values as it characterizes degrowth research. nicolas.kosoy [at] mcgill.ca (English, Spanish) Audrey Moores, Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry  “The Quebec government's green plan is an undeniable step forward that builds on a strength of the province: its large hydroelectric park. However, sustainable development is much broader than just the issue of CO2 emissions and transportation. In particular, the issues of waste, pollution, and the intelligent use of biomass are the major forgotten issues of the November 16th announcement.”  Audrey Moores is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry. A leading expert in the field of catalysis using metal, metal oxide and biomass-based nanomaterials, with a special emphasis on sustainable processes and use of earth abundant starting materials, she held the Tier II Canada Research Chair in Green Chemistry from 2007 to 2017. audrey.moores [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Frederique Mazerolle Organization: McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['ecological economics', 'economic policy', 'economic policy in Quebec', 'External', 'McGill experts', 'sustainability']"
Expert: Quebec-Massachusetts electric energy transportation,17 Nov 2020,"Published: 17Nov2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Hydro-Québec's energy corridor project, which will potentially supply electricity to the New England power grid, mainly to Massachusetts, has just passed an important milestone. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued the federal environmental permit for the New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) transmission line project. (Journal de Montréal) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: François Bouffard, Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  “The fight against climate change requires global solutions. Once constructed, the NECEC will displace carbon-based electricity generation in the New England market. Its construction will attempt to minimize environmental impacts on both sides of the border by sharing existing electricity transmission right of ways, while avoiding having to develop several land hungry renewable energy projects in the region.”  François Bouffard is an Associate Professor and a William Dawson Scholar in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Experts: Joe Biden wins U.S. presidential election,12 Nov 2020,"Published: 12Nov2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States on Saturday, November 7, positioning himself to be a leader who ""seeks not to divide but to unify"" a nation gripped by a historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil. Biden crossed the threshold of 270 electoral college votes with a win in his home state of Pennsylvania. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “Canada-U.S. relations have faced daunting challenges since the beginning of the Donald Trump presidency and many Canadians followed very closely the recent U.S. elections for a very simple reason: because the outcome truly mattered for Canada. The victory of Joe Biden should significantly alter, and possibly improve, Canada-U.S. relations.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and James McGill Professor of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Mugambi Jouet, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Law  “The 2020 presidential election epitomized how America stands far more polarized than other Western democracies. Its intense polarization has old roots. They have not only shaped a striking factual divide, but also conflicting views over issues like the basic role of government, wealth inequality, gender, religion, race, guns, criminal justice, foreign policy, and beyond. Many of these divides are interrelated and may remain significant after the election, unless a paradigm shift occurs.”  Mugambi Jouet is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law. His research focuses on criminal justice and comparative government from a multidisciplinary perspective. He is an expert on the distinctive historical evolution of American law, institutions, and sociopolitical culture compared to other Western democracies such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European nations. mugambi.jouet [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Jason Opal, Associate Professor and Chair, Department of History and Classical Studies  “Joe Biden won by doing two things: first, he mobilized traditional Democratic voters– – lower income people, highly-educated professionals, women, visible minorities, urbanites, etc. – somewhat better than Hilary Clinton did in 2016, resulting in crucial surpluses of votes in the ‘blue’ counties of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, plus Georgia. Second, he won over a modest number of independent voters, largely due to the incessant chaos of the Donald Trump years and the related botching of the COVID-19 pandemic. He ran as a moderate, because he is a moderate, and in this way, he was a believable and relatable candidate. However, Trump voters, rich and poor, turned out for their champion. Very few ‘red’ counties from 2016 switched to blue. It's crucial to recall that Trump also retained the support of traditional conservatives who hate taxes, unions, and regulations – because in many ways Trump is a traditional conservative who hates taxes, unions, and regulations. The Trump alliance – built on white, conservative, rural, and religious voters – remains strong.”  Jason Opal is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classical Studies, where he teaches and writes about the U.S. Constitution in different periods of American history.

Experts: Quebec City attack highlights need for discussion on mental health,3 Nov 2020,"Published: 3Nov2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Quebec is hoping to reduce wait lists and widen access to help by injecting $100 million into mental health services as the novel coronavirus pandemic continues, an announcement that was pushed up following a deadly sword attack in the province’s capital that killed two and left five injured. (Global News) Here are some experts from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Martin Drapeau, Full Professor, Departments of Educational and Counselling Psychology and Psychiatry  “The COVID-19 pandemic and the recent attacks in Quebec City illustrate, once again, that our health system does not adequately meet the need of Quebecers when it comes to mental health services. A significant increase in funding is needed for mental health services in our hospital system. In addition to this, Quebec should fund psychotherapy in the private sector. This would increase access to services and free up the public system who could then focus on the individuals who require multidisciplinary care.”  Martin Drapeau is a Full Professor cross-appointed to the Departments of Educational and Counselling Psychology and Psychiatry. His research is in the area of psychotherapy process and outcome, of best practices in psychology, and of knowledge translation and dissemination. martin.drapeau [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Nancy Heath, James McGill Professor, Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology  ""Increasing mental health services is essential. But what ARE mental health services? Absolutely we must make sure that those who need one-on-one therapy have access to it. However, many more would benefit from UNIVERSAL mental health outreach to build mental health resilience. We need to be proactive not just reactive and responding to individuals in crisis. We must not forget to help people cope with day-to-day life and must address mental health difficulties (such as stress and anxiety that interfere with quality of life but are not yet a clinical disorder) rather than wait until they meet criteria for mental illness.”  Nancy Heath is a James McGill Professor in the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology. Her research program explores resilience and adaptive functioning in young people at-risk (children, adolescents, and young adults). nancy.heath [at] mcgill.ca (English) Tina Montreuil, Assistant Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology  “Investing in mental health resources and support is a first step in the right direction. However, as research findings suggest, in order to ensure access and efficient use of resources, there is an urgent need to educate people on the importance of prevention and early access to care as well as to normalize and destigmatize mental health services. It is also critical to inform the population on the importance of self-care to promote resilience and well-being as we continue to experience the impact of the pandemic.”  Tina Montreuil is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology and an Associate Member of the Department of Psychiatry.

(CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey, Assistant Professor, Department of History and Classical Studies  “The 2020 US presidential election is far more consequential than academics, surrogates, and pundits have inferred. The United States is headed towards a precipice, regardless of which party wins, because the sectional/sectarian divides are widening by the day.”  Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies and a historian of post-Reconstruction United States, specializing on the African American experience. His research focuses on the intersections of the United States, Canada, and African Diaspora. wendell.adjetey [at] mcgill.ca (English) Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “Canada-US relations have faced daunting challenges since the beginning of the Trump presidency and many Canadians are following very closely the current US presidential campaign a simple reason: because its outcome truly matters for Canada.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and James McGill Professor of Political Science. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “The upcoming presidential election is symptomatic of deeper crises facing the US political system. On the Republican side, the pathology is obvious, as Donald Trump has transformed the party into a vehicle for his private enrichment while stoking white nationalism and feeding absurd conspiracy theories. But on the Democratic side, it is also telling that in the year of the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, at a time when young leaders are coming to the fore and calls for social justice are growing louder, the party has put forth as its standard-bearers a septuagenarian with an affinity for racist gaffes and a history of favouring big business and “tough on crime” policies, paired with a former prosecutor. Regardless of the outcome on November 3rd, it is unlikely that this deeper crisis of political representation will be resolved. If Trump wins or follows through on his refusal to allow a peaceful transition of power, a new wave of protests is virtually certain. A Biden victory is also unlikely to be willing or able to address the scope of demands that social justice movements and communities ravaged by coronavirus are raising. Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are unlikely to fade into the woodwork if he loses. The coming months are poised to be both incredibly uncertain and consequential.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology.

However, the damage Trump has done to American standing in the world, to the rule of law, to constitutional norms, and to the Republican Party will be difficult to undo, and even if he loses, the long transition period in the US means he could still do more harm before he leaves office.”  Jacob Levy is a Tomlinson Professor of Political Theory in the Department of Political Science and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Philosophy. He specializes in contemporary normative political theory, the history of political thought and legal and constitutional theory. jacob.levy [at] mcgill.ca (English) Jason Opal, Associate Professor and Chair, Department of History and Classical Studies  “If we put aside all the sound and fury of the past several months, the race is remarkably stable. From the outset, Joe Biden has had a modest lead over Donald Trump. The only change since September has been that Biden's lead has grown, mostly because of Trump's objectively awful handling of the pandemic but also due to the cumulative effect of several stories (The Atlantic piece on Trump's contempt for veterans; The New York Times release of his tax records, etc.). Finally, the COVID-19 outbreak in the White House has deepened the sense among many ‘middle-of-the-road’ voters that America simply requires a return to political normalcy, which Biden embodies. Hence, Biden is likely headed for a decisive win, and only a coordinated and probably violent coup by Trump and his supporters could stop it.”  Jason Opal is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classical Studies, where he teaches and writes about the US Constitution in different periods of American history.

One striking point is how Democrats themselves seem to agree that they need to win by a sizeable margin to win – not a good sign in a democracy. Even if Biden wins and we see a peaceful transfer of power, this does not mean that the country will go back to where it was in 2016. We can expect to see a different tone from a Biden administration, but it will still have to deal with the same level of polarization, and many of the trends that put Donald Trump in power will likely remain. Moreover, a Biden administration may have a similarly hostile stance towards China and skepticism towards trade openness.”  Krzysztof Pelc is an Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar in the Department of Political Science.

The sentencing was the culmination of several years of revelations about Raniere's program, NXIVM, which charged thousands of dollars for invitation-only self-improvement courses at its headquarters near Albany, N.Y., along with branches in Mexico and Canada. (CBC News) Here is an expert from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Rachel Langevin, Assistant Professor, Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology   “Sex trafficking, sexual violence, and rape are extremely harmful and are known to be associated with many short and long-term difficulties in terms of psychological, physical, relational, and sexual health. In the context of Raniere’ victims, there is the added layer of betrayal trauma and abuse of power. The young women trusted him, maybe even saw him as a father figure, and were relying on him given his position as the leader and his promises of self-help. I am happy to hear in this case that the survivors were believed and supported by the judge, as the judicial system can often be a place of re-traumatization for survivors of sexual violence. I am sure that most victims feel heard, seen, and that justice is done with a sentence like this one.”  Rachel Langevin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology and the Director of the Resilience, Adversity, and Childhood Trauma Research Lab.

Her research program explores resilience and adaptive functioning in young people at-risk (children, adolescents, and young adults). nancy.heath [at] mcgill.ca (English) Karen Hetherington, Faculty Lecturer, School of Social Work  “COVID-19 has widened persistent mental health inequities making things worse for those who are already vulnerable. The results of recent research undertaken by the British Columbia Division of the Canadian Mental Health Association and the United Kingdom Mental Health Foundation showed that mental health has declined for 44% of women and 32% of men since the beginning of the crisis. Despite these alarming figures, a high percentage of Canadians have maintained a healthy lifestyle, have begun exercising and have stayed connected to family and friends. However, in order to respond to this reality, we need more than individual measures. We will need to confront the impact of colonization, privilege, inequity, and injustice that characterize our mental health care system.”  Karen Hetherington is a Faculty Lecturer at the School of Social Work with nearly 50 years of experience in social services. She currently sits on the National Board of Directors of the Canadian Mental Health Association. Her key interests are in the area of mental health prevention and promotion, community development and international social work. karen.hetherington [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Tina Montreuil, Assistant Professor, Department of Educational & Counselling Psychology  “The COVID-19 pandemic landscape has highlighted the critical importance of assisting children, youth and families on how to build mental health well-being and resilience in a changing world. Given that 70 per cent of adults living with mental health problems report their symptoms began in childhood or young adulthood, the time has come to educate and inform key stakeholders and knowledge users not only that mental health resilience can be developed, but also on ways in which it can be achieved.”  Tina Montreuil is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology and an Associate Member of the Department of Psychiatry.

Low-income and marginalized communities have been most severely impacted by the disease itself, and by economic, social, and mental health consequences of confinement measures. Throughout human evolution and history, pandemics have brought about increased conflict, xenophobia, conspiracy theories, scapegoating, and drastic changes in social relations. In the age of smartphones, social media, ‘Zoomification’, and decreased face-to-face interactions, the COVID-19 pandemic has also spurred an unprecedented epidemic of isolation, uncertainty, fear, misinformation, and loss of trust in science, medicine, politics, and the public good.

Experts: Joyce Echaquan’s death: Racism in the healthcare system ,2 Oct 2020,"Published: 2Oct2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Quebec’s coroner’s office will be looking into the death of Joyce Echaquan, an Indigenous woman from the Atikamekw Nation of Manawan and a mother of seven children, who passed away amid troubling circumstances in a Joliette hospital on Monday, September 28. Before her death, Echaquan took a cellphone video from her hospital bed and livestreamed it on Facebook. Near the end of the video, which lasts around seven minutes, hospital personnel enter the room. The staff members can be heard insulting Echaquan and making derogatory comments about her. (Global News) Here are some from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue: Wanda Gabriel, Assistant Professor, School of Social Work   “We need to acknowledge the systemic racism that is prevalent in the Quebec healthcare system. The Viens Commission [Public Inquiry Commission on relations between Indigenous Peoples and certain public services in Québec: listening, reconciliation and progress] from 2019 has identified numerous calls to action. We must move to action to stop this cruelty.”  Wanda Gabriel is an Assistant Professor in the School of Social Work and a member of the Kanieke’ha:ke nation. She has worked closely with the National, Regional Indigenous agencies and Indigenous communities across Canada dealing with crisis intervention and issues of sexual abuse, lateral violence, internalized oppression, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence and residential school issues. wanda.gabriel [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Samir Shaheen-Hussain, Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics   “Joyce Echaquan was not the first Indigenous person to suffer a brutal death because of discrimination rampant on multiple levels in our healthcare system, but the provincial government has the power to make sure that she is the last. Tangible actions, including the implementation of anti-racist legislation, policies, and practices must be put in place to end medical colonialism and anti-Indigenous systemic racism in healthcare immediately. Otherwise, it is only a matter of time before another Indigenous person's wholly avoidable suffering makes headlines.""  Samir Shaheen-Hussain is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics and an emergency pediatric physician at the Montreal Children’s Hospital. He spearheaded the advocacy campaign #aHand2Hold, which brought about a change in government policy and ensured that hundreds of Indigenous children in Quebec can now be accompanied by their parents when they are flown south for care rather than being transferred alone. He is the author of Fighting for A Hand to Hold: Confronting Medical Colonialism against Indigenous Children in Canada. Saleem Razack, Associate Professor, Department of Pediatrics  “We now know that the individuals who performed these acts of overt racism have been held accountable and that an investigation is in progress. However, this approach only goes so far. There are clear systemic racism factors that have permitted such behaviours towards Indigenous peoples and which create systems whereby individuals are rarely held accountable. Nothing would have happened had there not been recorded evidence. We must therefore name the systemic racism in this occurrence and commit to deep and enduring structural change, in the spirit of truth and reconciliation.”  Saleem Razack is an Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics and the Director Social Accountability and Community Engagement Office at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences. He is also a pediatric critical care medicine physician at the Montreal Children’s Hospital.

Experts: International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste | September 29 ,28 Sep 2020,"Published: 28Sep2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      This year represents the first ever observance of the International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste. The COVID-19 pandemic continues generating significant challenges to food security in many countries. These challenges include disruptions in supply chains, quarantine measures, and the closure of much of the hospitality industry and schools. All these measures have resulted in a loss of markets for producers and distributors, making the situation even more challenging. (United Nations) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Patrick Cortbaoui, Academic Associate, School of Human Nutrition  “Food loss is not only a loss in food quantity, but also a loss of the natural resources required to produce that food. Reducing food loss is vital to increase food production without further compromising the environment and to achieve a sustainable food system for all.”  Patrick Cortbaoui is an Academic Associate at the School of Human Nutrition and the Managing Director of the Margaret A. Gilliam Institute for Global Food Security. His research interest is in the development and validation of applied engineering solutions to reduce post-harvest losses and waste of food commodities thereby increasing food availability without compromising the environment. patrick.cortbaoui [at] mcgill.ca (English) Daiva Nielsen, Assistant Professor, School of Human Nutrition  “Food loss and waste is a substantial issue affecting many countries around the world, and the developed countries where the food supply is abundant. There are many parts of the supply chain where food can be lost or wasted. In Canada, fruits and vegetables comprise one of the most frequently wasted food categories. There are viable solutions to help reduce food loss and waste, particularly through recovery or recycling options where food is donated or manufactured into food products for other purposes (e.g. animal feed). Bringing greater attention to this issue and the solutions is needed to help reduce food loss and waste in Canada.”  Daiva Nielsen is an Assistant Professor in the School of Human Nutrition. She is currently leading a study to compare household food procurement experiences across different regions in Quebec, including those more affected by COVID-19. daiva.nielsen [at] mcgill.ca (English) Pascal Thériault, Faculty Lecturer, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences  “The problem of food lost and waste in rich countries is still concerning. Our current food production model is in part responsible for it as is our behaviour as consumers. The COVID crisis did shed a light on aspects of our food production process that often led to overproducing to compensate for lower margins.”  Pascal Thériault is a Faculty Lecturer in the Farm Management and Technology Program and the Director of Community Relations at the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. A trained agricultural economist, his expertise includes agri-food marketing, entrepreneurship, farm business management, food waste, international trade and value chain management. pascal.theriault [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Frederique Mazerolle Organization: McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['agri-food', 'External', 'farm management', 'food & sustainability', 'food security', 'Food waste', 'McGill experts', 'School of Human Nutrition', 'sustainability', 'sustainable development', 'United Nations']"
Experts: The return of ‘Fridays for Future’   ,25 Sep 2020,"Published: 25Sep2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to overshadow most other topics in 2020, Canadian activists are joining demonstrators around the world to bring climate change back into the conversation. Protests, walkouts, and sit-ins are expected to take place in several Canadian cities, including Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, and Halifax, on Friday and Saturday to mark the return of the global Fridays for Future movement led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. (CTV News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Christopher Barrington-Leigh, Associate Professor, Institute for Health and Social Policy and School of Environment  “A lot of young people are overwhelmed with the future we continue to pass on to them. Happily, the post-transition world is going to be a better life for everyone, and Canada is at a tipping point at which unilateral action, for the first time, makes economic sense.”  Christopher Barrington-Leigh is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Institute for Health and Social Policy and the School of Environment and an Associate Member in the Department of Economics. His research makes use of subjective well-being reports to address the relative importance of social and community-oriented aspects of life as compared with material consumption. chris.barrington-leigh [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Dror Etzion, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Youth engagement on sustainability issues is perhaps the most powerful force in the world for creating change: As Al Gore once said, it is the ultimate “renewable energy”. Therefore, as a society, we should commend and support their bravery and commitment. The students would be wise to prepare some thoughtful answers – or maybe even pre-empt – the questions that are bound to rise regarding the wisdom of conducting demonstrations in the current state of the pandemic.”  Dror Etzion is an Associate Professor of Strategy and Organizations at the Desautels Faculty of Management and an Associate Member of the School of the Environment. His work suggests that managing for sustainability through local, open, emergent initiatives increases the recruitment of diverse stakeholders, fosters creativity, and yields impactful outcomes. dror.etzion [at] mcgill.ca (English, Hebrew) Blane Harvey, Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar, Department of Integrated Studies in Education   “The ‘Fridays for Future’ marches remind us that, despite the global focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis continues to worsen. Youth in Montreal and worldwide are calling for real action on this crisis, and for a stronger voice on the issue. The fact that they must take to the streets to get this message across highlights the lack of opportunities available to young people – through their schooling, or through federal and provincial politics – to be heard.”  Blane Harvey is an Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar in the Department of Integrated Studies and an Associate Member of the School of Environment. As an interdisciplinary scholar who works across the social and natural sciences, her research pertains to how climate change knowledge is produced, validated and communicated, and how facilitated learning and knowledge sharing can support action on climate change. blane.harvey [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Renée Sieber, Associate Professor, Department of Geography and School of Environment   ""Even in a time where virtual activism predominates and protects individuals' health, physical protest remains important. Technology cannot replace all the cues that one receives from participating: a sense of common interest by being able to look around, see and hear the interests that you share. Virtual activism fails to build strong social ties and is less durable because it usually requires less commitment on the part of the participant than physical activism. This is especially important for youth, who may feel otherwise socially isolated and unable to effect change in a world out of their control.""  Renée Sieber is an Associate Professor cross-appointed to the Department of Geography and the School of Environment and an Affiliated Member of the School of Computer Science. Her research focuses on rewiring geographic information systems for social change, tools for urban and sustainable development and virtual activism. renee.sieber [at] mcgill.ca (English) Emily Sprowls, PhD candidate, Department of Integrated Studies in Education  “Young Montrealers are not losing sight of their future beyond the current global pandemic, and they continue to build momentum in their calls for urgent climate action and justice. As educators and education researchers, we need to keep working to support students’ demands to reform our education systems to reflect the urgency of our climate and ecological crises. We must not miss the opportunity to listen to youth’s voices as they imagine new ways we might learn to build a sustainable future for Montreal, Canada and the world.”  Emily Sprowls is a PhD candidate in the Department of Integrated Studies in Education. Her research involves youth-led environmental education and citizen science. emily.sprowls [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English) Klara Winkler, Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Natural Resource Sciences  “The climate march is an important sign to show everyone that we need to transform our society because climate change will have more severe environmental, social, and economic consequences.

Experts: Trudeau’s Throne Speech ,22 Sep 2020,"Published: 22Sep2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      As Canada's parliament returns and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seeks to put an ethics scandal behind him, his government will unveil its plans this week for the country's pandemic response and recovery. The Liberal government is expected to announce plans to tackle both the immediate crisis – a new surge in COVID-19 cases as the country enters the colder months - and to a roadmap for a longer-term recovery. (BBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Daniel Béland, James McGill Professor, Department of Political Science and Director, McGill Institute for the Study of Canada  “Canada is facing tremendous economic, fiscal, and public health challenges, a situation that makes this throne speech especially meaningful from a policy standpoint. Politically, the presence of a minority parliament creates an even more complicated situation for the Trudeau government, which will likely face a confidence vote after the speech. An unusually significant throne speech.”  Daniel Béland is the Director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and James McGill Professor of Political Science. Since 2012, he has held the Canada Research Chair in Public Policy (Tier 1) at the Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy. He specializes in the fields of Canadian and comparative politics, as well as the study of public policy, including social policy. daniel.beland [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Olivier Jacques, PhD candidate, Department of Political Science  “It will be particularly interesting to see how the government of Canada plans to increase its revenues in order to reduce the deficit. Will it increase taxes on high income Canadians, tax the GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, or the ‘Big Five’) or reduce tax credits?”  Olivier Jacques is a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science. His doctoral dissertation, The Politics of Fiscal Policy Trade-offs in an Era of Permanent Austerity, concerns the comparative political economy of public finance in advanced democracies. olivier.jacques [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English, French) Erin Strumpf, Associate Professor, Department of Economics and Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health  “Additional federal health care funding will help provinces and territories navigate the large and ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, federal health care transfers should be accompanied by guidance and leadership so that all Canadians can benefit from sound testing strategies, accessible services, and high-quality care regardless of where they live.”  Erin Strumpf is an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics and the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health.

Expert: MEC to be acquired by private U.S. investment firm,17 Sep 2020,"Published: 17Sep2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Tens of thousands of people have signed on to a petition hoping to stop the sale of Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC) to a private U.S. firm. The sale was announced Monday September 14 and will see Los Angeles-based private investment firm Kingswood Capital Management acquire the business and its assets. As a result, the retailer will no longer operate as a member-owned co-operative. (Global News) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Charles De Brabant, Executive Director, Bensadoun School of Retail Management, Desautels Faculty of Management  “It is not surprising that it happened, since MEC was already having financial challenges before the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current crisis dramatically accelerated the challenges faced by MEC as a non-essential retailer and put them in an untenable situation. We will see if and how Kingswood Capital Management LP will succeed with this acquisition, as financial firms have been relatively unsuccessful in taking over strongly branded retailers with strong cultures and values like MEC. At the same time, there may be a great opportunity with the ‘staycation’ trend and more focus on outdoor activities not too far from home.”  Charles de Brabant joined McGill University in 2017 to co-lead the creation and the development of the Bensadoun School of Retail Management whose ambition is to be the leading academic institution in the world dedicated to the future of retail. With over 25 years of experience mostly working in Europe and most recently in China and South East Asia, his passions and expertise sit at the crossroads of people development, executive education and consulting in strongly branded and fast-growing retail environments. charles.debrabant [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Frederique Mazerolle Organization: McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Bensadoun School of Retail Management', 'Desautels Faculty of Management', 'External', 'McGill experts', 'retail', 'retail sector']"
Experts: International Equal Pay Day | September 18 ,17 Sep 2020,"Published: 17Sep2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      International Equal Pay Day, celebrated for the first time this 18 September, represents the longstanding efforts towards the achievement of equal pay for work of equal value. Across all regions, women are paid less than men, with the gender pay gap estimated at 23 per cent globally. Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls continues to be held back owing to the persistence of historical and structural unequal power relations, poverty and inequalities and disadvantages in access to resources and opportunities that limit women’s and girls’ capabilities. (United Nations) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Lisa Cohen, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Establishing fairness in pay is critical in organizations and yet extremely difficult to achieve. There is no universal yard stick with which to measure worth.”  Lisa Cohen is an Associate Professor at the Desautels Faculty of Management. Prior to joining Desautels, she was a faculty member at the London Business School, the Yale School of Management and the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, where she taught in the areas of strategic human resources, organizational behavior and communications. lisa.cohen2 [at] mcgill.ca (English) Brian Rubineau, Associate Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management   “The biggest contributor to the gender pay gap is segregation – the fact that men and women tend to work in different jobs. This segregation itself is a problem. Why should maids be paid less than janitors? Working for equal pay includes removing the barriers that keep interested and qualified women from male-dominated jobs.”  Brian Rubineau is an Associate Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Desautels Faculty of Management.

Lebanon said the Beirut explosion was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate — which was stored unsafely in a warehouse after being confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014 — being ignited. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue:  Rex Brynen, Professor, Department of Political Science  “Lebanon is facing a crisis on many fronts: economic collapse, the COVID-19 pandemic, a regional refugee crisis, and now the horrific explosion in Beirut—all aggravated by a corrupt and deeply dysfunctional political system.""

Experts: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden nears decision on running mate,5 Aug 2020,"Published: 5Aug2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice-presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals. The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice. The selection amounts to the most significant choice Biden has confronted in his nearly five-decade political career. He has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket. (CTV News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “Joe Biden has spent his entire career as a weathervane, adjusting his positions as the political winds shifted. In the 1980s and 90s, this meant that he bragged about slashing social programs, and enthusiastically supported ‘tough on crime’ policies that aggravated many of the problems that motivate #BlackLivesMatter protesters today, including mass incarceration and police brutality. Today, in the wake of #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, it means that he knows he must choose a woman, preferably a Black woman, as his running mate. This is progress, and a change from Trump’s overt racism and misogyny. But a more diverse Democratic Party ticket with Biden at the top will do little to solve the problems that have sparked one of the largest protest movements in U.S. history. Beyond the symbolism of potentially naming the first Black woman vice president, Biden’s policies are unlikely to address the calls for racial justice and structural reform that have grown louder in recent months.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology. As a comparative historical sociologist, his research explores the changing relationship between social mobilization, political processes, and ideology in advanced capitalist democracies. barry.eidlin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Jason Opal, Associate Professor and Chair, Department of History and Classical Studies  “Biden has two choices for VP: an experienced and known personality to evoke a kind of ""return to Obama-style normalcy,"" or someone who appeals to and represents the progressive-left elements in the Democratic Party. In category one, Susan Rice or Kamala Harris would be the front-runners, while in category two, Stacy Abrams would be the likely champion. Of course, Biden's choice speaks to the larger political tension that runs through his entire campaign, if not his entire career: How to appeal simultaneously to the elusive ""Middle America"" and to activist/progressive elements at the same time?”  Jason Opal is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classical Studies, where he teaches and writes about the US Constitution in different periods of American history.

Teachers can focus on providing an environment conducive to emotional security and instilling a feeling of self-efficacy to help vulnerable children have a smooth, enjoyable school experience, as they transition back to their school environment.”  A licensed clinical psychologist, Delphine Collin-Vézina is an Associate Professor in the School of Social Work, as well as the Tier II Canada Research Chair in Child Welfare, the Director of the Centre for Research on Children and Families and the Nicolas Steinmetz and Gilles Julien Chair in Social Pediatrics. Her research interests include clinical topics related to child maltreatment, child sexual abuse, and trauma. delphine.collin-vezina [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Experiencing ‘pandemic fatigue’  Jason Harley, Assistant Professor, Department of Surgery  “Anxiety isn’t the only emotion that can negatively impact the quality of our thinking and responsible behavior. As numbers continue to improve in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, we must also be vigilant of the influence that relief can have in directing our attention and influencing the way we make sense of COVID-19-related information. Like most things, relief is good in the right dosage because too much can lead to overconfidence, selectively attending to pandemic-related information, and adopting behaviors before they are advised for our and others’ safety.”  Jason Harley is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Surgery, an associate member of the Institute for Health Sciences Education and a Junior Scientist at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC). They are currently conducting research to investigate coping strategies health care workers are using to deal with stress during the pandemic, assess their effectiveness and use that information to recommend new measures to protect the mental health of health care professionals. In collaboration with the SAILS Lab, they are also a developing and testing public education tools to enhance COVID-19 health and media literacy with a special focus on the role of emotion regulation in promoting public understanding and adaptive health behaviors. jason.harley [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Relaxing distancing measures safely  Matthew Oughton, Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases  “As the majority of the population presumably remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, relaxing mitigation measures that have been in place since mid-March necessarily come with some risk. Those risks are manageable, provided that adequate testing and contact tracing continue to be performed and need to be balanced against the many regular activities that our population requires in order to function effectively.”  Matthew Oughton is an Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine and a specialist in infectious diseases and medical microbiology. He is based at the Jewish General Hospital, where he supervises the bacteriology and molecular microbiology laboratories. His research interests are focused on the use of molecular techniques to improve clinical diagnostic assays, with relevant publications on C. difficile, MRSA, influenza, and other pathogens. matthew.oughton [at] mcgill.ca (English) The future of the workplace Jean-Nicolas Reyt, Assistant Professor, Desautels Faculty of Management  “Business leaders are increasingly considering remote work as a long-term alternative, so as to reduce their real estate footprint. Managers who have no experience with remote workers face important challenges, such as monitoring performance, maintaining employee motivation, and onboarding new team members. Organizations need to redefine what ""management"" means in a world where employees work remotely.”  Jean-Nicolas Reyt is an Assistant Professor at the Desautels Faculty of Management. His research focuses on the relationship between employees' mental representations of their work and important work outcomes including creativity, exploratory learning, and interpersonal influence. He also studies mobile technology-facilitated work and other organizational factors that influence mental representations. jean-nicholas.reyt [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Worth the risk? Ross Otto, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology  “The onus of risk management has now shifted from the government to us as individuals. We may well see more variability in the way people manage risks, as it is now in our hands.”  Ross Otto is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology. He studies decision-making, and more particularly, why we sometimes rely on slow, deliberative, and effortful choices, while at other times we rely on fast, habitual, and reflexive choice. ross.otto [at] mcgill.ca (English)    Contact Information Contact: Frederique Mazerolle Organization: McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['COVID-19', 'Emerging infections (SARS/Avian Influenza)', 'External', 'McGill experts']"
Expert: International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict | June 19,19 Jun 2020,"Published: 19Jun2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict on June 19 raises awareness of the need to put an end to conflict-related sexual violence, to honour the victims and survivors of sexual violence around the world. It also pays tribute to all those who have courageously devoted their lives to and lost their lives in standing up for the eradication of these crimes. (United Nations) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Myriam Denov, Full Professor, School of Social Work and Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Youth, Gender and Armed Conflict  “Every year, thousands of women, men, girls and boys suffer sexual violence during and following armed conflict. An individual sexual violence survivor may not only suffer physical, psychological, social, and economic consequences from the assault, but it also can affect subsequent generations and the broader family and community in multiple and complex ways. Despite the growing attention to sexual violence during armed conflict, its intergenerational effects remain poorly understood – particularly in relation to children born of wartime rape. As a result of their birth origins, children born of war rape may face profound violence, stigma, exclusion, socio-economic marginalization from family and community, and are often prevented from accessing land, education, and health care. Children born of war rape face a distinct set of challenges and needs that have yet to be addressed in local, national and international policy and post-war programming.”  Myriam Denov is a Full Professor at the School of Social Work and holds the Canada Research Chair in Youth, Gender and Armed Conflict (Tier 1). Her research and teaching interests lie in the areas of children and youth in adversity, and international child protection, with an emphasis on war and political violence, children in armed conflict, and gender-based violence. A specialist in participatory research, she has worked with war-affected children in Asia, Africa, and the Americas and has conducted research on the reintegration experiences of former child soldiers in Sierra Leone and Colombia, and war-affected youth living in Canada. myriam.denov [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)    Contact Information Contact: Shirley Cardenas Organization: McGill University Email: shirley.cardenas [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: 514-398-6751 Mobile Phone: 514-594-6877",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['armed conflict', 'External', 'gender', 'International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict', 'Myriam Denov', 'survivors']"
Experts: World Elder Abuse Awareness Day | June 15,12 Jun 2020,"Published: 12Jun2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is an official United Nations International Day acknowledging the significance of elder abuse as a public health and human rights issue. Since 2006, communities throughout the country and around the world have honoured this day to raise the visibility of elder abuse by organizing events to share information and promote resources and services that can help increase seniors’ safety and well-being. (CNPEA) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Susan Mintzberg, PhD Candidate, School of Social Work  “As a society, we have regularly turned a blind eye on stigmatized populations such as seniors or those living with mental illness. Consequently, medical specialties such as geriatrics and psychiatry have been grossly underfinanced and lack the support needed to properly care for some of our most vulnerable citizens. As a result, family caregivers have become essential, yet invisible, frontline workers. The devastation we are currently witnessing in seniors’ homes due to COVID-19 pandemic has shaken our collective conscience and we must ensure that we do better moving forward.”  Susan Mintzberg is a PhD Candidate in the School of Social Work. Her research explores the role of families in the mental healthcare system. susan.mintzberg [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English, French)Mark Yaffe, Full Professor, Department of Family Medicine  “The victimization of seniors may be the result of their particular vulnerabilities, coupled with emotional problems and maladaptive behaviors on the part of those entrusted with some meaningful relationship or responsibility to them. This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has tragically spotlighted a global societal form of mistreatment arising from systemic or institutional failure to adequately address the basic survival needs of institutionalized older adults. One must be especially alert to the occurrence of elder abuse since the risk of it presenting appears to be possible even in the best of circumstances.”  Mark Yaffe is a Full Professor in the Department of Family Medicine and a member of the Department of Family Medicine at the St. Mary’s Hospital Center. His work on elder abuse is acknowledged internationally, as he has led an interdisciplinary team that developed and validated WHO-recognized Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI), a simple tool to assist family physicians in detecting elder abuse. mark.yaffe [at] mcgill.ca (English)    Contact Information Contact: Frederique Mazerolle Organization: McGill University Email: frederique.mazerolle [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: (514) 398-6693 Mobile Phone: (514) 617-8615",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['elder abuse', 'External', 'family caregivers and the elderly', 'Family medicine', 'McGill experts', 'School of Social Work', 'Seniors']"
Experts: George Floyd’s death: Racism and police brutality ,2 Jun 2020,"Published: 2Jun2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Demonstrators gathered to denounce racist violence and police impunity both in the U.S. and in Montreal. The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has sparked nightly protests in major U.S. cities. The Montreal rally was a solidarity gathering with American anti-racism activists, but organizers say it is also an opportunity to express their own anger at the treatment of marginalized people in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. (CBC News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Assistant Professor, School of Social Work  “The police will continue to remain a threat to the lives of Black and Indigenous communities unless we acknowledge the larger narrative of a colonial paradigm. Whiteness throughout history and still today, has provided the lens through which all institutional structures were built. Law enforcement in a society where Black people’s existence cannot be separated from the role of “other’”, is a contemporary manifestation of how governments have used violence to subjugate Black and Indigenous communities for centuries.”  Alicia Boatswain-Kyte is a social worker with over ten years of clinical experience working with marginalized individuals, families and groups. Her research interests center around the systemic oppression of racialized individuals and how this contributes to their unequal representation within systems of social control. Alicia advocates for transformative social change within institutions and social policies to ensure that all individuals and groups are able to participate as full and equal peers within society. She is involved with several community organizations aiming to improve the health and social outcomes for Black children and families in Montreal. alicia.kyte [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey, Assistant Professor, History and Classical Studies  “Anti-black racism, specifically the unprovoked executions of black people by police and vigilantes, is the legacy of chattel slavery and the regime of racial terrorism that has dictated black-white relations since the U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction. As a society founded on racial caste – that is, freedom and veneration afforded to white people compared to the outright subjugation and dehumanization of black people – the United States continues to experience racial strife because it has never truly confronted its past and thus it cannot comprehend its present situation. It is this racial powder keg that has mythologized Canadian society as racially harmonious, despite our own national fault lines.”  Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey is a historian of post-Reconstruction United States, specializing on the African American experience. Broadly, he studies the intersections of the United States, Canada, and African Diaspora. wendell.adjetey [at] mcgill.ca (English) Jan Doering, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  In both the United States and Canada, the police disproportionally surveil and mistreat Black people. Part of the solution is to reform police practices and disciplinary procedures. But the problem is also much bigger, because white people more frequently call the police in situations that involve Black people. As a result, police bias cannot be eliminated without also addressing deep-seated stereotypes and interests among whites.  Jan Doering is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology.

Experts: Hot weather and heat waves,27 May 2020,"Published: 27May2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Environment Canada issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area, warning that temperatures are forecasted to reach between 30 and 33 C this week. (CTV News) Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Leighanne Parkes, Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases  “As summer approaches, many patients and health-care workers (HCWs) will request the use of air conditioners, coolers or electric fans to control the climate. Such climate control, as ambient temperatures dangerously rise, is important for the safety of patients and HCWs alike. Unfortunately, there is insufficient data on the impact of this equipment in patient rooms, particularly with respect to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. What limited evidence that does exist suggests that these devices might perpetuate outbreaks. Accordingly, risk mitigation strategies should be employed.”  Leighanne Parkes is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine and an infectious disease specialist and microbiologist at the Jewish General Hospital. She is currently collaborating in a McGill-led clinical research initiative to test the efficacy of existing drugs against COVID-19, in the hopes they may improve outcomes as a vaccine is being developed. leighanne.parkes [at] mcgill.ca (English) Christopher Labos, MD, MSc and Associate, McGill Office for Science and Society  “I think people underestimate how dangerous extreme temperature, both hot and cold, really is. Every year we see spikes in death rates during heat waves or cold spells and the great tragedy is that a lot of these are preventable. Very simple things like air-conditioning and making sure you stay hydrated are extremely important especially for older individuals and those with pre-existing heart conditions and other medical problems.”  Christopher Labos is an associate with the McGill Office for Science and Society whose mission is to promote critical thinking and present science to the public.

Expert: International Day for Biological Diversity | May 22,21 May 2020,"Published: 21May2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      May 22 is International Day for Biological Diversity. As the global community is called to re-examine its relationship to the natural world, one thing is certain: despite all our technological advances we are completely dependent on healthy and vibrant ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, fuel, shelter and energy, just to name a few. The 2020 theme “Our solutions are in nature” emphasizes hope, solidarity and the importance of working together at all levels to build a future of life in harmony with nature. Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Anna Hargreaves, Assistant Professor, Department of Biology  “Biodiversity goes deeper than the number of species. Species interact in an incredible diversity of ways and those interactions knit together ecological communities and drive the evolution of new and ever more fascinating species. The biodiversity of species interactions - how they compete, with each other, eat each other, hide from and trick each other, and sometimes even work together - is to my mind the true richness of Earth's biodiversity. Species interactions run our living planet and makes it infinitely fascinating and worth cherishing far more than we currently do.”  Anna Hargreaves is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology. Her research focuses on conservation, ecology, evolution, and behaviour. Her work explores interactions among species. She conducts field-based experiments in natural environments to test and refine theoretical ideas in ecology and evolution that have practical conservation relevance. anna.hargreaves [at] mcgill.ca (English, French, Spanish) Anthony Ricciardi, Professor, Redpath Museum and McGill School of Environment   ""We live in an age of biological invasion – the spread and proliferation of organisms into areas of the world where they have never previously occurred. Throughout the history of life, species have spread into new regions; but under human influence, plants, animals, microbes, and viruses are being moved faster, farther, and in greater numbers, than at any previous time in Earth’s history. The rapid proliferation of the coronavirus across the planet shows how vulnerable we are to this phenomenon. The COVID19 pandemic is a predictable result of ecosystem alteration, wildlife exploitation, and global connectedness – a sinister combination that accounts for other recent epidemics and pandemics (such as Zika, H1N1, SARS, and MERS) and will continue to drive novel infectious disease outbreaks in the future. Therefore, we must direct our efforts toward managing not only the pathogens themselves but also the environmental factors that facilitate their emergence, spread, and impact. Cross-disciplinary collaborations between biomedical researchers, epidemiologists, sociologists, and ecologists are vital to limiting future outbreaks.""  Anthony Ricciardi is a Full Professor cross-appointed to the Redpath Museum and the McGill School of Environment, and an associate member of the department of Biology.

The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) and Environment for the Americas (EFTA) have joined forces to strengthen global recognition and appreciation of migratory birds. This year the theme of World Migratory Bird Day is “Birds Connect Our World” and was chosen to highlight the importance of conserving and restoring the ecological connectivity and integrity of ecosystems that support the natural movements of migratoy birds and that are essential for their survival and well-being.   Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue:   Kyle Elliott is an assistant professor in the Department of Natural Resource Sciences and the Canada Research Chair in Arctic Ecology.   ""The impacts of climate warming are greatest in the Arctic. What does the changing ecology of seabirds tell us about arctic ecosystems? Information about the top predators such as sea birds integrates information over many scales, thus providing unique opportunities to assess ecosystem change. As food used by northern people, top predators also provide early warning signals for changes in human health. How does reduced ice affect marine wildlife? I also work with other researchers to study the at-sea distribution of seabirds. We use accelerometers, depth loggers and GPS units to follow thick-billed murres and other seabirds in the Arctic. Of particular interest are the colonies whose foraging range overlaps with the proposed shipping lanes for the immense Baffinlands mine. The ultimate goal is to provide a map of key biological hotspots in the Arctic to guide resource development in a changing North (shipping lanes, oil spill management, fisheries, national reserve design, etc.).""

Experts: World Day for Safety and Health at Work 2020,23 Apr 2020,"Published: 23Apr2020  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      On April 28, the UN World Day for Safety and Health at Work will focus on the enormous challenges facing governments, employers, workers and their organizations as they try to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and protect safety and health at work. Beyond the immediate crisis, there are also concerns about resuming activity in a manner that sustains progress made in suppressing transmission. Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue:   Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology  “The pandemic has shown that millions of workers who, just a few weeks ago were deemed ‘unskilled’, are in fact essential to the basic functioning of our society. Workers in grocery, warehousing, transportation and logistics, communications, and utilities are on the front lines of this pandemic every bit as much as their fellow workers in health care. They are putting themselves in harm’s way to ensure that the rest of us can stay safe at home. But even as health care workers face shortages of basic personal protective equipment (PPE), these other front-line workers are left vulnerable, often without the most basic PPE. They need protection, and they need to be paid at a level that is commensurate with the essential nature of their work.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology. As a comparative historical sociologist, his research explores the changing relationship between social mobilization, political processes, and ideology in advanced capitalist democracies. barry.eidlin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)   Marie-Lyne Grenier, Faculty Lecturer, School of Physical & Occupational Therapy  “Globally, many workers and students are adapting to the shift to working and learning from home. This shift comes with particular risks to one’s physical and mental health. Ensuring an ergonomic working or learning space can decrease the risk for physical and mental health difficulties. Resources to help guide workers and students are abundant online. However, sifting through these resources to determine evidence-based ‘best practices’ is much more challenging and yet vital to preventing further risks to workers’ physical and mental health. Tips for how to set-up an ergonomic space that is based on sound evidence should be prioritized for at-home workers and learners to decrease health risks during this period of social distancing.”  Marie-Lyne Grenier is an Occupational Therapist and Faculty Lecturer at the School of Physical & Occupational Therapy. She is also an ergonomic specialist and a consultant. marie-lyne.grenier [at] mcgill.ca (English, French)   Chantal Westgate, Senior Faculty Lecturer, Desautels Faculty of Management  “For many people the gig economy is just an opportunity to make extra money. But according to studies, the gig economy is the primary source of income for one third of its workers. There are impacts, both mental and physical, resulting from being involved in the gig economy that range from underemployment , to a lack of control over one’s hours, to stress from working more than one job, and reduced well-being due to the uncertainties of working in this sector.”  Chantal Westgate teaches a variety of organizational behavior courses at the undergraduate, graduate, continuing education, and executive training levels.

Here are some experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Eric Galbraith, Professor, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences   ""For decades, we have tried - and failed - to act on climate change. It seemed as though real progress was impossible and that we were locked into a zombie walk into the future. Governments seemed to care about profits much more than people. However, the response to COVID-19 has turned that upside-down. It shows that most governments of the world are ready to put the welfare of people first. This is great news for our future, and that of our planet. We will need to push our governments to keep working for people, once we have made it through the COVID-19 pandemic.""  Eric Galbraith is a Professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. He has worked on climate change, biogeochemistry and ecology. His current work aims for an integrative understanding of global sustainability problems, combining Earth system science approaches with simple representations of the global human system. eric.galbraith [at] mcgill.ca (English) Elena Bennett, Professor, Department of Natural Resource Sciences and McGill School of the Environment  “I am heartened by the speed with which humans have responded to the coronavirus. I think the tools people have developed to deal with the pandemic may be helpful in confronting climate change and other important environmental issues. The mutual aid efforts that have sprung up to get groceries or make masks for vulnerable people show the potential for community action. The call for people to stay home — and the measurable impact of social distancing efforts when people comply — reveals the importance of official actions and the need for every person to participate. In the months and years to come, when a covid-19 vaccine is developed and the pandemic is contained, I hope people won’t forget these bright spots - that we will take these good things and hold onto them and figure out how to steer them toward the larger climate conversation. I also know that, while individuals and community groups can make progress, we also clearly need strong and supportive interventions from civil society and government to help push in the right direction. One group alone can’t make this happen.”  Elena Bennett, is a Professor in the Department of Natural Resource Sciences, an ecosystem ecologist and the co-founder of the group Seeds of Good Anthropocenes which collects and studies the ways that people address environmental problems.

Bernie Sanders to the Democratic U.S. presidential nomination, the field of contenders needed to get smaller and the vote of Democratic moderates had to coalesce behind one candidate – in less than a week, both of those requirements have now been fulfilled. Former vice-president Joe Biden's stunning performance in the Super Tuesday primaries not only resurrected his foundering third attempt for the U.S. presidency, it has made it all the more likely that the nomination will not have to be decided on the floor of the Democratic National Convention in July. (CBC News) Here is a McGill expert who can provide on this issue: Barry Eidlin, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology   “After Super Tuesday, Joe Biden has reclaimed his status as the front-runner for the Democratic Party nomination. While Biden benefited from the other moderate candidates dropping out to rally around him, he will now face greater scrutiny as the race narrows to two candidates. Going forward, the race has boiled down to a clear contest between the Democratic Party establishment and its progressive/democratic socialist left wing. At this point the establishment wing has the upper hand, but if the past few weeks have shown anything, it’s that the situation on the ground can shift rapidly.”  Barry Eidlin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology.

My take is that being treated equally is not equivalent to being treated the same. It is only when we, as a community, appreciate this point and use it in our policies that we will achieve true equity.”  Natalie Dayan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine and the Director of Obstetric Medicine at the McGill University Health Centre.

It is the structures and the way work are organized that create and maintain inequality. Research on differences in workplace outcomes for men and women often focusses on differences between men and women. It is equally important to focus on how men and women are placed in different locations in the workplace and in different jobs.”  Lisa Cohen is an Associate Professor at the Desautels Faculty of Management. Prior to joining Desautels, she was a faculty member at the London Business School, the Yale School of Management and the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, where she taught in the areas of strategic human resources, organizational behavior and communications. lisa.cohen2 [at] mcgill.ca (English) Melissa Sonberg, Professor of Practice, Desautels Faculty of Management  “A big issue in this world is whether we need quotas to have meaningful growth in the number of women in the C-Suite and in corporate boards.

This is how Manon Wascher describes the “Airbnb nightmare” she has gone through since the apartment complex she lives in on Guy St. was sold four years ago. Wascher says there are between 30 and 50 of the building’s 230 units being rented on the popular travel website. (Montreal Gazette) 	Here is a McGill expert who can provide on this issue:David Wachsmuth, Assistant Professor, School of Urban Planning  “The situation Manon Wascher has been facing in her Guy St. apartment makes clear what communities, policymakers and researchers have known for several years now: Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms need to be regulated much more strictly in Montreal, to ensure that our housing is protected from being converted into de facto hotels, and our residents don’t wake up to discover that their former neighbours are now a rotating cast of tourists. Our research suggests that 5000 homes in Montreal have been lost to short-term rentals, and that number keeps increasing. The City of Montreal has taken some positive steps to get the situation under control, and once new provincial rules come into effect in May, I hope that the Province invests the necessary time and resources into enforcing them, so that Montreal can keep its housing for local residents.""

First, Sanders is not to be underestimated, especially given his field operation and small-donor fundraising prowess. Second, Biden is in trouble, although the disarray of the caucuses gave him a reprieve. Third, Buttigieg’s bizarre declaration of victory with no actual reported results may have undermined his candidacy instead of boosting his momentum.

It seems likely that negotiations will continue in bad faith and may well result in the 'no-deal' catastrophe that the previous parliament worked so assiduously to avoid in 2019.

Expert: Dutch high court decision - reduced carbon emissions a human right,20 Dec 2019,"Published: 20Dec2019  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   The Dutch high court has just upheld a decision that obliges the Dutch government to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2020 to protect the human rights of its citizens. (New York Times) This McGill University  expert can provide comment on this issue: Prof. Sébastien Jodoin is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law at McGill University. His main area of expertise is the relationship between human rights and climate change. “Today’s decision by the Dutch high court is the most important climate judgment in the world. It establishes that governments are obliged to reduce their carbon emissions to protect the human rights of their citizens from the adverse effects of climate change. In addition to serving as a precedent in the application of the European Convention of Human Rights, this decision is a persuasive source that is relevant to the interpretation of the obligations of governments to combat climate change under the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms. It puts the federal and provincial governments on notice that a failure to adopt measures to limit increases in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees, in accordance with scientific consensus and the objectives enshrined in the Paris Agreement, constitutes an infringement of the human rights of Canadians.” Sébastien Jodoin is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law of McGill University, where he directs the Law, Governance & Society Lab.

The second charges him with obstruction of Congress for stonewalling investigative efforts. (CBC News) Here are experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Jacob Levy, Professor, Department of Political Science  “Impeachment in the US Constitution is not truly a criminal process, but a remedy for serious abuse of office. President Trump has clearly passed that threshold; the fact that he's almost certain not to be removed by the Senate demonstrates that the process in the US is genuinely broken.”  Jacob Levy is a Tomlinson Professor of Political Theory in the Department of Political Science and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Philosophy.

As of Dec. 15, airlines now must abide by the Canadian Transportation Agency’s (CTA) second set of rules intended to protect travellers when their trips don’t go as planned. (CTV News). Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: John Gradek, Faculty Lecturer, School of Continuing Studies  “The latest introduction of the Air Passenger Rights regulation on December 15th, 2019 will finally bring Canadian passenger rights closer in line with those regulations in the US and the EU. There remains, however, serious loopholes in the regulations that would permit airlines to withhold compensation due to operating practices. Such practices by EU carriers do not negate their obligations to compensation, so the Canadian regulations may yet change to get them closer in line with EU ones.”  John Gradek is lecturing in the Diploma program in Integrated Aviation Management as well as in both the certificate and diploma programs of Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Operations Management.

(New York Times) Here is an expert from McGill University that can provide comment on this issue: Lindsay Duncan, Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar, Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education  “A 4-year ban on Russia is a reasonable sanction that addresses the doping problem on the level that it occurred (state-level rather than individual-level). The 4-year ban imposes consequences for people who have been active in facilitating doping activities but still sends a message to athletes that if they commit to clean sport there is a path for them to international competition.”  Prof. Lindsay Duncan is an Associate Professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education and the Director of the Theories and Interventions in Exercise and Health Psychology (TIE) Laboratory.

(CMAJ) 	Here is a list of experts from McGill University who can provide comment on this issue:Christopher Labos, Associate Member, McGill Office for Science and Society  “The tendency to use e-cigarettes indefinitely is why this recent cluster of vaping-related lung disease is such a concern. Why this sudden uptick of cases has come about is not entirely clear. Case reports of severe respiratory failure from vaping are not new. Some date as far back as 2015. Thus, it’s possible that cases were going undiagnosed or unappreciated until the current episode made everyone take notice.”  Christopher Labos is a physician with a certification in cardiology.

Experts: Impact of transit construction on travel behaviour and health of Montreal residents,18 Nov 2019,"Published: 18Nov2019  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Montreal is undertaking a major overhaul of its transportation networks and services, with major projects like the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) and the Pie-IX bus rapid transit (BRT) underway. To examine the impacts of projects that are under-construction on the travel behaviour and the health and well-being of Montreal residents, researchers at McGill University are inviting commuters to participate in the Montreal Mobility Survey. Here are experts that can provide comment on the preliminary results:   James DeWeese, Graduate Student, School of Urban Planning, McGill University  “The planned shut-down of the Mount Royal tunnel to allow for the REM’s construction is going to alter or disrupt daily commutes for thousands of transit riders and drivers alike. Our preliminary survey results suggest that a significant percentage of people are going to eschew public transport all together during the shutdown. Transit agencies and transportation officials need to prepare for and minimize that shift.”  James DeWeese is a graduate research assistant in urban planning at McGill University. He was formerly a research analyst with the World Resources Institute in the United States, where he researched municipal climate adaptation and subnational efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. His current research interests include sustainable public and active transport with an eye toward improving environmental performance and quality of life. james.deweese [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English, Spanish) Trent Bonsall, Graduate Student, School of Urban Planning, McGill University  “With major developments across the island, Montreal is on track for a major overhaul of its transport networks. This is going to mean big changes in how people get around and how they feel about getting around – not just once the projects are complete, but while they’re under construction. All of this has serious implications for policymakers who are concerned about public health, equity, and economic development. It’s imperative that we, as researchers, understand the linkages between these types of transport investments and public well-being so that we can help guide better outcomes.”  Trent is a graduate research assistant at the School for Urban Planning at McGill University. He received his undergraduate degree in economics and French from Middlebury College in Vermont. Previously he worked for an international non-governmental organization in Austria and in cultural management in France.

(La Presse) Here are experts from McGill University that can provide comment on this topic:  “The commission on juvenile sex trafficking is undertaking important work in demystifying taboos and investigating the prevalence and impact of sex trafficking in minors. The holistic mandate to not only strengthen measures to combat human trafficking, but also to look at prevention and rehabilitation for victims and their families is an encouraging step towards helping affected and vulnerable Quebec youth. Health care professionals can play an important role in identifying, treating and advocating for victims of human trafficking because of the high likelihood that a victim will seek medical treatment during captivity.”  Françoise Filion, Assistant Professor, Ingram School of Nursing, McGill University Françoise Filion is an Assistant Professor at the Ingram School of Nursing at McGill University, where she teaches community health nursing and works with several underserved populations.

Life after (and during) a PhD – a project designed to change expectations & the culture of the academy,12 Jun 2019,"Published: 12Jun2019  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      For the past four years a cross-Canada project developed by McGill University, TRaCE, has been gathering stories and data about life after (and during) a humanities PhD. The goal? To shift the expectations of PhD students away from a single-minded focus on a future in academe (since only about 30% will end up with tenure-track jobs) and give them a sense of a range of satisfying possible careers. The results? Data from 4,200 people who graduated with PhDs from across the country about a range of different career paths; stories and reflections from 450 of the graduates themselves about the path they chose; connections between former and current PhD students across the country; and a new activist group formed by the PhD students across the country who have being carrying out the research. Why cover this story now? Because, over the next 3 years, the research is both broadening . . . and focusing. Broadening, by recounting the experience of PhD students from all faculties. Focusing by looking at PhD students from McGill, which, as it approaches its bicentennial, and in recognition of a changing job market, an Individual Development Program has been set in place to encourage PhD students to reflect on where they are going and develop skills needed for what they want to do – whether it’s inside the academy or outside.

Much of the cathedral we were able to enjoy until yesterday was the work of 19th-century restorers, Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc in particular. And much of the imaginary associated with Notre-Dame is a product of the 19th century, starting of course with Victor Hugo’s arch famous Notre-Dame de Paris. Now the team of restoration architects working for the French government will have to decide whether to restore the monument back to its 19th-century appearance, or aim for a more medievally 'authentic' version. What is the meaning of 'authenticity', and whether or not the 19th century is an 'authentic' part of a complex historical layering are interesting and difficult questions.""—Martin Bressani  Martin Bressani, architect and architectural historian, is Professor and Director at McGill University’s School of Architecture.

Expert: 100th anniversary of the International Labour Organization,9 Apr 2019,"Published: 9Apr2019  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      On April 11, the International Labour Organization (ILO) will celebrate its 100th anniversary and Adelle Blackett, Canada Research Chair in Transnational Labour Law and Development, is available to discuss with reporters why this organization is still relevant today. For example, Professor Blackett is fighting for Canada to ratify the ILO’s Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189) which sets minimum standards to make domestic work more decent and fair, and recognizes domestic workers’ freedom of association. She developed a 12-week course inspired by the agency’s international vocation culminating on April 11. “McGill holds a unique place in the history of the International Labour Organization,” explains Professor Blackett. Created in 1919 as part of the League of Nations, the ILO is the world’s oldest international organization. In the torment of World War II, Canada offered a refuge to this agency charged with the promotion of social justice and human and labour rights, from 1940 through 1948. From its temporary headquarters at McGill, the ILO prepared its post-war future and worked on its constitutional annex, the 1944 Declaration of Philadelphia, a declaration which Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to as “a landmark in world thinking”. Contact: adelle.blackett [at] mcgill.ca (English and French)",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,['External']

This would be problematic from a legal point of view. The FCA held that the federal government breached its duty to consult First Nations. That duty is anchored in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and is not part of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian Charter gives legislatures two ways (and only two ways) to avoid the constitutional limits it imposes: s. 1 (the limitations clause) and s. 33 (the notwithstanding clause). Neither of these apply to s. 35, which, again, lies outside the Canadian Charter. So it is far from clear where the federal government could acquire lawful legislative authority to avoid the duty to consult the FCA says it owes to First Nations.”  evan.fox-decent [at] mcgill.ca (English)     		      Contact Information Contact: Justin Dupuis Organization: Media Relations Office Email: justin.dupuis [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: 514-398-6751",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['External', 'Sébastien Jodoin', 'Trans Mountain']"

Amnesty for Caribbean Immigrants in Britain: A Question of Moral and Human Rights Protection ,18 Apr 2018,"Published: 18Apr2018  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised to Caribbean leaders over the Windrush generation controversy, at a Downing Street meeting. She said she was ""genuinely sorry"" about the anxiety caused by the Home Office threatening the children of Commonwealth citizens with deportation. The UK government ""valued"" the contribution they had made, she said, and they had a right to stay in the UK. It comes amid reports some are still facing deportation. (source BBC News)   Jose Mauricio Gaona, O'Brien Fellow, McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism, Faculty of Law The 1971 Immigration Act granted indefinite leave to Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK to remain in the country without requiring documentation. Yet subsequent reforms require immigrants in the UK to prove their immigration status. Since the arrival records of the so-called Windrush generation (i.e., approximately 524,000 people coming from Caribbean nations) were destroyed in 2010 by the government under a data-protection policy, it is now more difficult to ascertain their immigration status. Even though British Prime Minister Theresa May recently acknowledged that these immigrants are British, some of them have been deported, detained, or denied employment, health care, and housing services due to the lack of evidence regarding their immigration status.  A moral and human rights case therefore emerges. First, unlike amnesties grated to undocumented immigrants in other countries (e.g., US Amnesty in 1986), the Windrush generation was legally present in the UK before the government’s policy changed. Second, immigration amnesty is a political decision based on moral grounds aimed at overcoming immigration and human rights situations that current laws often cannot envisage. The mistakes the government made, the political support (140 MPs from all parties), and the need to protect basic human rights (human dignity, equality, liberty) are compelling reasons to grant immigration amnesty.  Topics: Constitutional, immigration, and international law Languages: English, French, Spanish, and Italian.

(Institut national de santé publique) Thomas Brown, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University and Researcher, Douglas Institute  ""This report underscores the risk of under-age drinking. Young drinkers are particularly susceptible, as not only are they inexperienced in the use of alcohol, they are at a stage in their lives when the attraction and external reinforcement for risky drinking are at their peak. It also highlights the continuing efforts of the alcohol beverage industry to encourage alcohol misuse in a vulnerable population by manipulating packaging (catchy and youth-oriented branding), ingredients (being sugar-laden) and accessibility (low prices). These strategies are not new, as similar tactics were blatantly deployed in promoting tobacco use in the past. The same measures to discourage under-age tobacco use are relevant here. Prevention of alcohol misuse is clearly the bailiwick of the provincial government, who has the monopoly for alcohol distribution, and oversees retailing.""–Thomas Brown  Thomas G.

On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13768 “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” which directed federal agencies to ensure a faithful execution of immigration laws against removable aliens. As a result, DHS — following U.S. AG legal opinion — rescinded DACA. On January 9, 2018, federal district judge, William Aslup, granted a preliminary injunction promoted by the University of California against the U.S. government to restore DACA, ordering USCIS to accept DACA renewals until further notice. As Trump uses funding for his “Wall” and Democrats-in-Congress a government shutdown to force an immigration deal, the lives of 800,000 ""Dreamers"" are on the line.  Topics: International legal scholar expert in the areas of constitutional, immigration, and international law   jm.gaona [at] mail.mcgill.ca (English, French, Spanish, Italian).",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['and international law', 'constitutional', 'DACA', 'External', 'immigration', 'Jose Mauricio Gaona', 'O’Brien Fellow at the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism', 'TPS']"
Expert: Labour groups protest Tim Hortons’ response to Ontario minimum wage,10 Jan 2018,"Published: 10Jan2018  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Labour organizations across Ontario are holding rallies today to protest the actions some Tim Hortons franchises have taken in response to an increase in the province's minimum wage. (The Globe and Mail)   Barry Eidlin, Professor of Sociology at McGill University “The move by some Tim Horton’s franchisees to claw back worker benefits while blaming it on the recent minimum wage hike seems timed to score political points more than to respond to any actual economic considerations. More broadly, it highlights two key problems with work in Canada today. First, the fact that too many workers’ day-to-day lives remain subject to the unilateral, arbitrary whims of their employers. Second, the way that the franchise business model creates incentives for small business owners to cut corners, while allowing large corporations—the franchisors—to evade responsibility for the conditions they create.”—Barry Eidlin Professor Eidlin is a comparative historical sociologist interested in the study of class, politics, inequality, and social change.

Expert: Why You Should Pay Attention to K-pop Group BTS Performing at The American Music Awards,17 Nov 2017,"Published: 17Nov2017  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      The K-pop boy group BTS (aka Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean) or “Beyond the Scene” (English)) will be performing live at the American Music Awards (AMAs) this Sunday in Los Angeles. This will mark the first time that a K-pop group has had a solo stage performance on an American music awards show, after Psy performed with MC Hammer during the 2012 AMAs. Michelle Cho is the Korean Foundation Assistant Professor Department of East Asian Studies at McGill University. She studies among other things Korean pop culture and the construction of identity in South Korean popular media. Here she answers three questions about the hype surrounding BTS. What is the hype around BTS? BTS has garnered a huge fanbase in North America, and has achieved the rare feat of charting on the Billboard Hot 100 albums chart, despite having little access to radio airplay and no official music promoters in North America. They are noteworthy for their savvy use of social media platforms, especially twitter and YouTube, to communicate directly with their fans, and recently reached the milestone of 10 million twitter followers on their BTS_twt account. Why is their presence on Sunday American Music Awards significant? Their success in reaching fans outside of the Asian region and their ability to break into the US music market is being watched carefully by Kpop and US pop artists and producers. It is rare for a group from outside of the US or UK to capture such attention in the world’s dominant pop music market, the US, thus, BTS is a phenomenon worth tracking, not only for their cultural significance to Koreans or the spread of Korean culture abroad, but also because their strategies and musical styles suggest an innovative form of direct audience engagement that has the potential to shift industry practices in many contexts. Is BTS also popular in Montreal? Absolutely. Here’s a video clip from a group of Kpop cover dancers based in Montreal, dancing BTS’s recent hit, which they will also perform at the AMAs. A former student is a prominent member of this dance group, and I have interviewed her about the group and its activities, which originally began as a group of friends from the CEGEPs Marianopolis and Dawson, but is now quite a YouTube phenomenon in itself.

Second, this proclamation affirms previous predictions indicating that the Trump’s administration will use the Political Questions Doctrine to restrict migrants from entering the United States, i.e., no branch of government may intervene with the otherwise constitutionally and naturally allocated political decisions of the executive branch (Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 1962). Although this doctrine has proven successful in the past and particularly in relation to national security concerns, the Trump’s administration seems to be adding now a new prong to this equation: “other public-safety reasons,” which propels a differential constitutional review.

Trump's efforts to close America's borders to trade and migration imperil religious liberty, the rule of law, and protections from arbitrary police power and abuse. The combination of the planned wall, the expansion of the power of border police, and the grossly unjust Muslim ban mark a dangerous shift toward American authoritarianism.

The United States is also violating international law with respect to those arrivals who are seeking refugee status or who are claiming relief under the Convention against Torture.On its face the order discriminates on the basis of national origin.  Statements that President Trump made upon signing, as well as the majority-Muslim status of the countries from which applicants are excluded, suggest that it could be found to discriminate on the basis of religious affiliation as well.  		The inclusion of 'green-card holders' (landed immigrants or permanent residents), at least initially, in those who were refused entry into the United States is particularly perplexing given the extensive review that applicants for permanent residence undergo.  They have been thoroughly vetted.""—Andrea Bjorklund  A renowned expert in international arbitration and litigation, international trade and international investment.

There are two executive orders being challenged. 		The first one is an indefinite ban on refugees traveling from Syria to the United States. This restriction is unconstitutional because it violates international treaties (UN Refugee Convention of 1951 and Asylum Protocol of 1967) and U.S. Congress Act (8 U.S.C.A Section 1225) as well as at least 15 U.S. Supreme Court direct precedents (going from Marbury v. Madison 1803 to Whitman v. America Trucking Associations, Inc. 2001 U.S. S. Ct.) concerning the separation-of-powers and nonlegislative-delegation doctrines. The President, in essence, cannot use executive orders to legislate indefinitely.  The second executive order, i.e., a temporary restriction for 90 days to travel from and to seven Muslims countries, raises a different problem, which varies depending on the immigration status of the person challenging the constitutionality of the order. However, it is very likely that the Trump’s administration will try to persuade Congress to act, in which case the ban could become permanent. In brief, unlike the President, Congress has plenary immigration power over aliens (Fiallo v. Bell 1977 U.S. S. Ct.), which has enabled it in the pass to ban permanently foreign citizens based on their political beliefs (i.e., aliens have no right to enter the United States, Kleindienst v. Mandel 1972 U.S. S.

Floods in Quebec,9 May 2017,"Published: 9May2017  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Suzanne King, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University and Douglas Institute 	She can talk about the importance of keeping pregnant women away from stress, for themselves and their baby. Professor King is a specialist in prenatal maternal stress. She began the Iowa Flood Study right after major flooding in this US state in June 2008. Her group added disaster questionnaires to an existing study of pregnant women for whom mental health data had been collected prior to the flooding.   514-761-6131, ext. 2353 (office), suzanne.king [at] mcgill.ca  Sarah El Outayek, PhD Candidate, Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics, McGill University     She does extreme rainfall modelling to study the trends of these phenomena in the future. She observes that there has been an increase in the number of extreme rain events over the years, and that with climate change there will be more and more events of extreme rain such as what we experienced in the past days. Her research will allow to have better models to estimate the quantity of rain and when it falls during extreme rain events. This will enable engineers to design infrastructure that are more suited to extreme rains (for example, increasing hydraulic infrastructure capacity, more green space, less concrete). sarah.outayek [at] mail.mcgill.ca",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['climate change', 'External', 'flood', 'McGill Department of Psychiatry', 'Quebec', 'rain']"

Yet the city has not demonstrated outstanding results in terms of job creation and collective wealth generation in the past few”.  ""The OECD report highlights Montréal's strengths, while pointing out weaknesses in the productivity of its economy and innovation system. The proposed plan of action, which seems to want to transform Montréal into Boston or San Francisco, does not seem to take into account the significant inequalities and land pressures that characterize these high-GDP cities. Also, it does not seem to take full account of certain institutional realities unique to Montreal and Quebec. The fact remains that a certain decompartmentalization of economic silos and a revitalization of its SMEs, without causing major transformations, would not hurt the Montréal economy."" —Richard Shearmur, Professor, School of Urban Planning, McGill University  Over the last few years, Professor Shearmur has been conducting research on where innovation takes place, how firms interact with their local and more distant environments in order to innovate, and what consequences firm-level innovation has on the local economy.

McGill University at the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS),14 Feb 2017,"Published: 14Feb2017  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Hynes Convention Center - Boston Jumpstarting Neurological Research through Open Science – MNI & McGill University Friday, February 17, 2017, 1:30-2:30 PM/ Room 208 Neurological research is advancing too slowly according to Dr. Guy Rouleau, director of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) of McGill University. To speed up discovery, MNI has become the first ever Open Science academic institution in the world. In a five-year experiment, MNI is opening its books and making itself transparent to an international group of social scientists, policymakers, industrial partners, and members of civil society. They hope, by doing so, to accelerate research and the discovery of new treatments for patients with neurological diseases, and to encourage other leading institutions around the world to consider a similar model. A team led by McGill Faculty of Law’s Professor Richard Gold will monitor and evaluate how well the MNI Open Science experiment works and provide the scientific and policy worlds with insight into 21st century university-industry partnerships. At this workshop, Rouleau and Gold will discuss the benefits and challenges of this open-science initiative. Genomic and Health Data: Global Sharing and Local Governance: Sharing genomic and health data – a human rights issue Saturday, February 18, 2017, 1:00 PM-2:30 PM/ Room 309 Genomic and health-related data are collected and stored separately at the moment. But Professor Bartha Knoppers from McGill University and the other members of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) believe that if this information were shared it could lead both to targeted new therapies and better allocation and management of resources by governments. Given this context, they argue that global data sharing should be viewed as a human rights issue, and that citizens’ groups should be able to hold their governments accountable for slowing down or impeding certain forms of data sharing that would be of benefit to all. The Alliance has developed a framework for responsible genomic and health-related data sharing that ensures that people’s right to privacy will not be put at risk. Assessing the Impact of Medical Marijuana: The Grass Could Be Greener Sunday, February 19, 2017: 8:00 AM-9:30 AM/ Room 311 The legalization of marijuana remains a topic of intense debate. The majority of U.S. states have legalized some form of medical marijuana use, and nearly 2 million people are registered medical marijuana users. That number is rising rapidly because of both increased access to medical marijuana and promulgation of its potential therapeutic effects. This week, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston, Dr. Mark Ware  of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre will present an overview of the data generated from the Quebec Cannabis Registry. The innovative project, the first of its kind in the world, was established by the Research Institute of the MUHC and the Canadian Consortium for the Investigation of Cannabinoids (CCIC), to help physicians manage medical cannabis use and generate a database for the use of the international scientific community.    Student poster competition Key implications of data sharing in pediatric genomics and clinical care Sunday, February 19, 2017/ Exhibit Hall Vasiliki Rahimzadeh, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada Background: Genomic testing using next generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized our ability to identify disease-causing mutations for many conditions. This holds particularly true for children, in whom many (rare) genetic diseases first appear during childhood and optimal clinical management requires early diagnosis and treatment. Interpreting the results of such tests requires genotypic and phenotypic comparisons to reference data that must be obtained from both healthy populations and other affected individuals. The sensitivity and specificity of genomic testing undergird ethical safeguards against informational risk. They furthermore outline how, and under what circumstances data may be shared. Current pediatric data sharing practices have until now subscribed to siloed ethics norms/guidelines that apply either to the research or clinical contexts separately. Appropriate sharing of linked genotypic and phenotypic data in pediatric populations has, in turn, received sparse empirical and policy attention.   For interviews at AAAS please contact: Katherine Gombay, Public and Media Relations, McGill University, katherine.gombay [at] mcgill.ca, 514-717-2289",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['AAAS', 'Bartha Knoppers', 'Expert', 'External', 'Guy Rouleau', 'mark ware', 'mcgill', 'professor', 'Richard Gold', 'Vasiliki Rahimzadeh']"

Le traumatisme est lourd, et le processus de deuil qui commence est d'autant plus exigeant que cet attentat nous fait vivre des émotions ambivalentes et douloureuses. Si nos unissons nos voix, il pourra aussi devenir une occasion de résistance massive face à la peur et aux divisions, aux discours polarisés qui déshumanisent l'autre et nient l'apport de la différence à la richesse de l'identité québécoise. Une action concertée des services sociaux, de santé et d'éducation permettra de faciliter ce délicat processus de deuil collectif, pour que la mobilisation le soutienne, et pour que les possibles dérapages soient contenus. »-Cécile Rousseau    Dr. Rousseau is part of an emergency clinical team in Quebec City which specializes on violent radicalization and is among  8 clinicians, psychiatrists and psychologists, specially trained to help around the radicalization theme, and ready to intervene in schools or wherever need be.

However, estimates published in 2015 in Nature suggest that maintaining the global temperature below 2oC might require leaving one third of the existing oil reserves in the soil. Canada still has work to do to live up to its expectations by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015.” 	— Catherine Potvin, Dept. of Biology, McGill University She’s the force beyond a network of scholars from across Canada, Sustainable Canada Dialogues, that drafted a climate action plan for the country released in March 2015. The scholars have argued that immediately beginning the transition to a low-carbon society this will bring opportunities for stimulating businesses and social innovations while improving livelihoods.  They called for a massive investment in renewable energies.  catherine.potvin [at] mcgill.ca (English, French) “This is exactly what the Liberals did on climate change issues in the 1990s. They say all the right things at international conferences. But their actual policies support the status quo in the exploitation of fossil fuels. The approval of these pipelines delays and undermines, rather than supports, the transition to a clean energy system that is required for Canada to fulfil its international obligations to combat climate change. It also reflects a broken system for energy governance that continues to favour short-term economic development over the interests and rights of citizens and communities and the long-term future of the planet.” 	— Sébastien Jodoin, Faculty of Law, McGill University He’s an expert in environmental law and sustainable development. His research seeks to understand law and public policy in the context of the manifold forces associated with globalization, processes of social change, new and evolving forms of public and private governance, and the pursuit of sustainability at various levels. sebastien.jodoin-pilon [at] mcgill.ca, (English, French) “With the approval of these pipeline projects, the Canadian government has signaled its willingness to place short-term considerations ahead of the long-term sustainability of the Canadian economy. The opportunity to establish Canada as a credible, global leader in responding progressively to climate change is slipping away.” — Darin Barney, Communication Studies, McGill University He’s the Grierson Chair in Communication Studies, member of the Petrocultures Research Group and the After Oil  partnership. Prof. Barney is beginning a project on pipelines as media of political action. darin.barney [at] mcgill.ca (English) “The Northern Gateway was turned down, seemingly on the basis of risks presumed intolerable to Douglas Sound  and the Great Bear Rainforest and possibly, other purely environmental issues, but not on the basis of social non-acceptance or native objections. On the other hand, the Trans Mountain project was approved despite natives, community, municipal and provincial opposition. Should we conclude that only purely environmental, but not social, native, municipal and provincial opposition, are sufficient reasons not to approve pipelines ? Should we project such a reasoning for the eventual discussions on approval of Enbridge ""Énergie-Est"" despite Montreal urban community and Québec government possible opposition?” 	— Michel A.

The Neuroscience of HIV: World AIDS Day (Dec. 1),30 Nov 2016,"Published: 30Nov2016  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Dec. 1 is World AIDS Day, a time to raise awareness about a disease that has afflicted 70 million people worldwide, 35 million of whom have died as a result. When most people think of AIDS, they generally do not think of a neurological disease, yet HIV infection can have an important impact on brain function. Untreated, HIV can cause severe dementia. Researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, together with investigators at other universities and clinics across Canada and in Australia, are conducting a major study to better understand the effects of HIV infection on brain health. 850 people living with HIV have volunteered for the study, and are undergoing regular cognitive testing over three years, along with detailed assessments of their general health, mood, day-to-day function and quality of life.  “While we wait for the outcome of our study, we recommend that people living with HIV take particular care of their brain health: stop smoking, get regular exercise, and enough sleep,” says Lesley Fellows, an MNI neurologist and the study’s lead investigator. “Minimize drugs or alcohol that might slow brain function. Eat a healthy diet with lots of vegetables, whole grains and fish. Stay mentally active and engaged, whether at work, in a volunteer role, or through a hobby or social group. These are recommendations for everyone, but we think they are especially important steps to take if you live with HIV.”  Lesley Fellows, Department of Neurology & Neurosurgery, McGill University Dr. Lesley Fellows is a neurologist specializing in disorders of cognition. Her research programme focuses on the brain basis of decision making in humans, using the tools of cognitive neuroscience. lesley.fellows [at] mcgill.ca",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Department of Neurology & Neurosurgery', 'External', 'Lesley Fellows', 'MNI', 'World AIDS Day']"
Why are 7 Million Canadians at greater risk of chronic disease?,23 Nov 2016,"Published: 23Nov2016  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   There is a growing body of evidence linking dental diseases to general health conditions, such as diabetes and pneumonia, and the barriers facing the estimated seven million Canadians who are unable to access dental care. Paul Allison, Dean, Faculty of Dentistry, McGill University  “We need to start thinking differently about the delivery of dental care, particularly for the most vulnerable members of our society.

The discussion will cover how and why tablet time should be regulated, are iPads affecting children’s developing brains, and how to tell the good from the bad when selecting iPads apps for kids. - Adam Dubé  Adam Dubé studies how deep conceptual understanding is acquired and applied. To this end, he investigates how educational technology augments the learning process. Does the tactile nature of tablet computers constitute a ‘hands-on’ interaction and is it a formative factor in tablet computer learning? Is 3D printing a viable method for learning about the construction of everyday objects? Are games able to simultaneously entertain and educate? If so, how does learning within a game occur and does it change how the content is understood? His work also investigates conceptually-based problem solving in the area of simple mathematics.

Experts: Earthquakes in Italia and Burma,24 Aug 2016,"Published: 24Aug2016  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   A strong earthquake in central Italy reduced three towns to rubble as people slept early Wednesday, with reports that at least 50 people were killed and hundreds injured as rescue crews raced to dig out survivors.” (CBC) “An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 has shaken central Burma, the U.S. Geological Survey says.” (CBC) Rebecca Harrington, Earth & Planetary Sciences McGill University She uses observational approaches to study the source of earthquakes and other “non-conventional” seismic signals such as volcanic hybrid earthquakes, and non-volcanic tremor. She’s available for TV+radio media interviews today. 514-398-2722, rebecca.harrington [at] mcgill.ca (English) Christie Rowe, Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University  “The M6.2 earthquake of August 23, 2016 struck only 45 km away from the epicentre of the 2009 L'Aquila Earthquake (M6.3) which killed over 300 people. Yesterday's quake occurred on a similar fault to the 2009 earthquake, and has already produced large aftershocks (up to M5.5) which continue to shake the region during rescue efforts.  The central Apennines region is subject to earthquakes like yesterday's event because of the motion of the tectonic plates. A continental rift structure runs in a northwest-southeast trend along the Italian peninsula and includes several major faults similar to the one which generated yesterday's quake.  Although the Aug 23, 2016 and the 2009 event were moderate sized earthquakes, the effects in central Italy are devastating. The 2009 earthquake at L'Aquila caused thousands of casualties and the Aug 23 earthquake has likely had similar effect. In many cases, modern buildings can withstand shaking of this intensity without structural damage, but the central Apennines region of Italy many Medieval buildings as well as modern buildings fell or sustained damage. —Christie Rowe   “The western Quebec seismic zone has produced earthquakes as large as M5.8 (in 1732), and the Charlevoix region has had even greater earthquakes (as large as M7, in 1663). Most construction in the region postdates these larger events, so it is not known how well Montreal's architecture will stand up to the shaking. A 2013 report from the Insurance Bureau of Canada selected the St Lawrence Valley region (stretching from Ottawa through Montréal to Québec City as the second most likely area in Canada (after southern BC) to experience a damaging earthquake in the next 50 years.” —Christie Rowe  She studies the geology of faults and leads the Field Rheology Rowe Research Group.

Loanable funds, which in the past was the target of central bank interest rates, is no longer readily available, since banks all over the G7 are sitting on excess reserves, and are afraid to advance loans into the dangerous markets they believe to exist. The only way new lending will be profitable for creditors is for general economic health to return to markets—something policy makers, especially in the USA, have been unable to bring about.

Opinion: Canada's Leadership in the Refugee Crisis,9 Oct 2015,"Published: 9Oct2015  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   By Myriam Denov and François Crépeau   Over the past decade, Canada has been notably absent from the world stage in leading humanitarian initiatives, such as during the recent refugee crisis.  With more than 11 million Syrians displaced thus far, Canada can and must do more. While Syrian refugees are fleeing unimaginable violence, global responses have ranged from indifference, to building walls and closing borders, to practices of detainment or “push back”. Migration is mostly portrayed by receiving nations as a calamity, to be dreaded and prevented at any cost. The coming election is an opportune time to change this and to hold politicians directly accountable, making the refugee crisis a priority campaign issue. Party leaders must respond to the call for action and commit to the following.  Canada must first resettle greater numbers of refugees annually. Considering its annual immigration intake, Canada has the capacity to welcome 30,000 refugees per year. The government could initiate a “matching system”, sponsoring one refugee for every refugee sponsored by a private organization, as was done for the Indochinese forty years ago. The refugee selection process must be expedited within transit countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan), with the assistance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and in line with Canadian priorities (for example, families with children, and unaccompanied minors). As migration will remain a normal feature of contemporary globalized life, we must welcome refugees at a steady rhythm over several years, through regularly updated five-year plans, adapting them to the crises as they happen. As a nation, we must invest in a well-developed long-term refugee integration plan that includes support for a network of resettlement NGOs, targeting language acquisition, schooling of children, and work integration programs. Such investments will pay off and document that refugees actually cost less in social services than the economic contribution they bring to Canada in the long term. We must adopt a position of international leadership, encouraging all countries – in the Global North and beyond (Brazil, Chile, and Argentina for example) – to do their part in welcoming refugees. Think of it, if each of the 32 Global North countries made an annual commitment relative to their population, 3.5 Syrian refugees could be resettled over 5 years.    Canada can take the lead by hosting an international conference, bringing together key leaders and stakeholders from, at least, all nations of the Global North. The goal of the conference would be the creation of a global five-year plan to resettle around 3 million refugees. The payoff to these initiatives would be significant for both refugees and host countries. Offering legal and safe migration avenues would reduce migrant smuggling and deaths at sea. The stress on national refugee status determination systems would decrease, as selection would be done directly in transit countries. Scenes of chaos at borders would be mostly replaced by legal and secure resettlement processing mechanisms. Canada could regain a global leadership role, drawing on our peacekeeping roots and demonstrating our capacity to mobilize partner nations and organizations during a humanitarian crisis. It would send a welcome message to transit nations who have made valiant efforts to support refugees, potentially bolstering Canada’s position in the Middle East. Best of all, our response could leave a lasting mark, serving as a model to address other humanitarian crises elsewhere around the globe. While refugee movements around the globe will not end soon, Canada has veered away from its roots as a leader of soft diplomacy. The election campaign is a chance to reset our compass. Canada should mobilize politicians of all stripes to embrace a political discourse that values mobility, diversity, pluralism, ultimately portraying migration not as a calamity, but as an immense opportunity.

Cars: Understanding magnesium corrosion,5 Aug 2015,"Published: 5Aug2015  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget     Image by ACS - Analytical Chemestry.   In the fight against climate change, fuel efficiency in cars is crucial. One way to lower fuel consumption is to use new alloys such as magnesium, which is 30% lighter than aluminum, to decrease the weight of cars. However, because magnesium corrodes easily this is a not yet a viable solution for the automotive industry. That’s why McGill researchers are trying to better understand the mechanisms involved in magnesium corrosion. Phillippe Dauphin-Ducharme, PhD student in chemistry at McGill University, and Janine Mauzeroll, associate professor of chemistry at McGill University both wrote a cover feature article in Analytical Chemistry published on August 4th 2015 about magnesium corrosion. Phillippe Dauphin-Ducharme was also interviewed on the podcast of Analytical Chemistry about the article.     Expert: Janine Mauzeroll, director of the Laboratory for Electrochemical Reactive Imaging and Detection of Biological Systems, Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry, McGill UniversityExpertise: Expert in electrochemistry, her research focuses among other things on corrosion, batteries, biosensors and multidrug resistance.Contact: janine.mauzeroll [at] mcgill.ca.

It focuses on raising awareness on viral hepatitis, and using this awareness to influence real change. (Source: World Hepatitis Day Canada)  “Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects at least 268,000 Canadians and causes greater disease burden than any other infectious disease in the country. In 2015, the release of well-tolerated, short course treatments (~12 weeks) able to cure >95% of treated patients revolutionized HCV therapy. However, treatment is extremely costly and puts a significant burden on the Canadian health care system. Thus, managing treatment costs, identifying those infected (many Canadians remain undiagnosed) and improving treatment engagement in those most in need will be a key challenge.” 		- Selena Sagan  Expert: Selena Sagan, Department of Microbiology and Immunity, McGill UniversityExpertise: Her lab is focused on understanding the mechanisms of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA accumulation in the liver.Contact: 514-398-8110. selena.sagan [at] mcgill.ca.

2015 World Blood Donor Day - June 14,11 Jun 2015,"Published: 11Jun2015  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget    Event: Every year, on 14 June, countries around the world celebrate World Blood Donor Day. Transfusion of blood and blood products helps save millions of lives every year. However, in many countries, demand exceeds supply, and blood services face the challenge of making sufficient blood available, while also ensuring its quality and safety. Today, in just 62 countries, national blood supplies are based on close to 100% voluntary unpaid blood donations, with 40 countries still dependent on family donors and even paid donors. http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-blood-donor-day/2015/event/en/ In 2013, Canada lifted its nearly 30-year-old ban on gay men giving blood, allowing only those who are abstinent to be allowed to donate. The policy, which was implemented by Canadian Blood Services allows men to donate blood if they haven't had sex with another man for five years before the donation. The lifetime ban against donations by gay men was instituted in the mid-1980s by the Red Cross, which was then responsible for the blood supply system. The move was taken when it was realized that the alarming new disease AIDS, which was then untreatable, could be contracted through blood transfusions. Expert: Mark Wainberg, Director, McGill AIDS Centre 	Professor, Medicine, and Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University 	Head of the HIV/AIDS research axis, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital 	Past President of the International AIDS Society 	Expertise: Criticism of the ban has even hit the medical literature. “The current policy is counterproductive in terms of loss of donors, loss of good will, student protests, donor boycotts and lawsuits, among other negative effects,” wrote Wainberg in a 2010 paper for the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

They often affect people whose work depends critically on voice, such as teachers, coaches, salespeople, politicians, and singers. The singer Adele, for example, cancelled a tour in 2011 because of voice problems, but good treatment allowed her to make a successful comeback. Voice problems can lead to loss of employment and depression. What can be done Most problems can be prevented or self-managed. Screening for emerging problems in a voice clinic (imaging of vocal cords, sound testing of the voice) Good voice habits (modifying and resting one’s voice, drinking water, avoiding dry-air environments…) Treatments for major problems range from exercises to injecting a drug into the patient’s throat or other types of surgeries. The future of voice health Researchers are now looking at ways to diagnose some problems using lasers instead of doing biopsy which involves minor surgery. Potential interviewees  Dr Karen Kost is a medical doctor and Director of the Voice Clinic at the Montreal General Hospital. She can comment on screening, therapy and what is good “vocal hygiene”. Prof Nicole Li, Assistant Professor of Faculty of Medicine at McGill, is in charge of a research lab on voice disorders. She can talk about voice therapy and the research behind that. Corina Vincelli is a professional singer and was treated for voice problems at Dr Kost’s clinic.

Source: bbc.com/news/world-asia-32014307 Expert : Dr. Sarah Moser, Assistant Professor, Department of Geography Dr Moser can comment on the impact Lee Kuan Yew has had on the country: ""the massive influence he and his developmentalist approach has had globally, particularly in authoritarian contexts his inability to adapt to changing expectations for leaders how he maintained a rather authoritarian approach until the end and lacked the ability to reflect on how the leadership qualities that worked in the 60s and 70s were not suitable in the present, particularly with a much more educated and sophisticated citizenry challenges the Singapore state is facing in the coming years, as the population is frustrated by the top-down leadership and angry about the break-neck pace of change and growing gaps between rich and poor. A national election is coming up and with the all-powerful Lee Kuan Yew gone, his son is likely to face unprecedented challenges to his leadership."" Research interests ""My research examines how national, religious, and ethnic identities shape cities in Southeast Asia and the Muslim world more broadly. I am fascinated by the transnational circulation of identity, architecture and urban policy and how cities across Asia are looking elsewhere in the global south rather than to ‘the west’ for inspiration.  My current work investigates the global emergence of supra-national religious and ethnic identities and how they are manifested in urban form and used to serve secular nation-building purposes. In particular, I examine emerging pan-Islamic identity, the ‘Arabization’ of Muslim identity and the effect these broad trends are having on urban areas.

February is Heart Awareness Month,29 Jan 2015,"Published: 29Jan2015  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget    February is Heart Awareness Month, an opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of cardiac health and encourage people to adopt healthy lifestyle habits that could help prevent heart disease and stroke, which represent two of the three leading causes of death among Canadians. Additionally, heart disease and stroke costs the Canadian economy more than $20.9 billion every year in physician services, hospital costs, lost wages and decreased productivity, (Conference Board of Canada).   Heart-related statistics from the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada: ·        Up to 40,000 cardiac arrests occur each year in Canada. That’s one cardiac arrest every 12 minutes. Without rapid and appropriate treatment, most of these cardiac arrests will result in death. Thousands of lives could be saved through public access to automated external defibrillators. ·        Almost 16,000 Canadians die each year as the result of a heart attack. Most of these deaths occur out of hospital (Statistics Canada, 2012c). ·        Every 7 minutes in Canada, someone dies from heart disease or stroke (Statistics Canada, 2011c). ·        Stroke is the third leading cause of death in Canada. Six percent of all deaths in Canada are due to stroke (Statistics Canada, 2012). ·        Each year, over 14,000 Canadians die from stroke (Statistics Canada, 2012). ·        Each year, more women than men die from stroke (Statistics Canada, 2012).

Top events in 2014,11 Dec 2014,"Published: 11Dec2014  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Here’s a list of important events of 2014 selected by the Media Relations Office of McGill University, with a paragraph of comment from a McGill expert on each news topic.    Ebola epidemic  “The world cannot afford to turn a blind eye to what is happening in West Africa at this very moment in respect to Ebola, because if it continues to spread it will touch all our lives.  Tourism has already declined in South Africa, a country thousands of miles away from West Africa. If Ebola comes to North America or Europe, the economic and social effect would be immense (e.g., people would keep their children from school and stay home to look after them, etc).  The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by January, 1.4 million people will become infected and the mortality rate from this Ebola strain is up to 71%.  The Ebola outbreak originated from wildlife, as did SARS and HIV, thus knowing the interactions between wildlife and humans has become a paramount question in order to understand how to prevent another outbreak.” Colin Chapman - Department of Anthropology & School of Environment  colin.chapman [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Ukraine/Crimea annexation  “2014 was a dramatic year for Ukraine. In January and February, the peaceful pro-European protest known as Euromaidan escalated. President Yanukovych pushed through draconian anti-protest laws and attempted a violent crackdown, but instead lost control and was forced to flee the country. Within a month, Russia intervened in Ukraine's majority ethnic-Russian region of Crimea, engineered a quick referendum, and annexed the territory. In April, Russian government agents and volunteers stoked local grievances against the new government in Kyiv and fomented an armed insurgency, which Ukraine's newly elected President Poroshenko has tried to defeat militarily. The conflict in Eastern Ukraine has taken over 4000 civilian lives and has displaced close to 500,000 people. Ukraine has suffered a humanitarian catastrophe, state dismemberment, and a weakened economy. The silver lining is that Ukrainian civil society has strengthened and the newly elected parliament is less fractured than ever, dominated by a 75% strong pro-European coalition. The geopolitical consequences of the Ukrainian crisis are also profound. The aggression in Ukraine has soured Russia's relationship with Europe and North America and produced rounds of mutual sanctions.  Russian President Vladimir Putin's popularity at home has soared in the wake of the Crimean annexation and it remains to be seen whether the economic effects of the sanctions will put a dent in it.” Maria Popova – Department of Political Science maria.popova [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Islamic State “The rise of the self-proclaimed “Islamic State” has seen the conquest of substantial areas of Syria and Iraq, mass atrocities, and military action by a US-led international coalition (including Canada) intended to weaken and ultimately destroy the extremist group. However, it is unlikely to disappear soon. It will have an effect on the Middle East and on global jihadist movements for some time to come. Meanwhile, the Syrian civil war rages on at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and 3 million refugees since 2011.” Rex Brynen – Department of Political Science rex.brynen [at] mcgill.ca (Email) China’s economic slow down “On Friday, November 21, for the first time since July 2012, China cut its one year lending rate from 6% to 5.4% and its one year deposit rate from 3% to 2.75%. This was in response to disturbing data that indicates that China's growth rate is slowing down. This concerns the rest of the world both financially and socially. China, in recent years has represented a very large portion of the world's consumption of energy and base metals. Not only are more cars now sold in China than the US or any other country, but China currently buys about half the world's copper production. Socially, it was once explained to me that China is like that bus in the movie ""Speed"". Now that it has achieved a certain growth rate associated with an irreversible migration of rural Chinese from farms to factory jobs in cities, it cannot stop or China will blow up.” Ken Lester – Desautels Faculty of Management klester [at] lesterasset.com (Email) World Cup 2014 in Brazil “The 2014 World Cup in Brazil highlighted the political irrelevancy of high-cost global sporting events. While the feared disruptions due to protests and poor preparation were minimal, Brazil’s embarrassing defeat, economic slowdown, and concerns about political corruption and the Cup’s high costs just months before national elections would have suggested that the days of the incumbent Workers Party Government were numbered. Yet, it was re-elected narrowly. Ironically, this was largely the same story that accompanied the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Cynically, one might suspect that the FIFA understands this all too well, hence the lack of concern for the controversies surrounding the Qatar games.” Philip Oxhorn – Department of Political Science philip.oxhorn [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 “The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may well turn out to be the greatest mystery in aviation history. The world watched in shock for weeks and then months as the search effort for the lost plane unfolded, becoming the most expensive in history. Flight 370 raised questions about how flights are tracked, and the inept handling of the event by the Malaysian government. Hopefully, this tragedy might provide some improvements to the way flights are tracked and how they communicate their location.” Karl Moore – Desautels Faculty of Management karl.moore [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Rosetta Mission – Probe landing on a comet “After 10 years of travel in the cold empty space of our Solar System, the European Space Agency's probe Rosetta caught up with the Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.  After orbiting the comet from August 6 to November 12, Rosetta released Philae, a small lander the size of a washing machine. The mission is to analyze the surface and sub-surface composition.  Despite a somewhat rough landing, the success of the Philae mission represents technical prowess; landing on a comet half a billion kilometres away from us had never been done before. Since comets have remained unaltered since the formation of our Solar system, analyses of the data collected by Philae and Rosetta will help us answer the fundamental question of the origin of life on Earth.” Sébastien Guillot – Ph.D researcher – Department of Physics sebastien.guillot [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Luka Rocco Magnotta Trial  “The Luka Magnotta trial is noteworthy on several grounds. One of them is whether jury members are at risk of developing traumatic stress symptoms after bearing witness to the gruesome evidence. There are very few mental health services offered to individuals accepting to serve on jury duty.” Dr. Alain Brunet – Douglas Mental Health University Institute and McGill’s Department of Psychiatry  alain.brunet [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Gaza War “The most recent Gaza War, continued Israeli occupation and settlement activity, and growing violence in Jerusalem have all highlighted the cost of the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict. US-mediated talks ended in failure in April 2014, and there is little prospect for the resumption of meaningful negotiations any time soon. A failure to act, however, could make the conflict ever more intractable.” Rex Brynen – Department of Political Science rex.brynen [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Quebec provincial election “The April 2014 election in Quebec brought both stability, with the return of a majority Liberal government in power, and change as the Parti Québécois experienced a crushing defeat that could potentially transform the party system in the province in fundamental ways. Pauline Marois, Quebec’s first female premier, lost both her seat and her leadership after barely 18 months in power as voters rejected both the identity politics of the controversial Charter of Values and the sovereignty clarion-call of her star candidate, Pierre Karl Péladeau. Former Liberal Health Minister Philippe Couillard brought the Liberal Party of Quebec roaring back to life despite the backdrop of the Charbonneau Commission inquiry into political corruption. In all, the PLQ attracted 41.5 % of the vote across Quebec and formed a majority with 70 seats, while the PQ slipped to a historic low of 25.4 % of the vote (its lowest vote share since first running candidates in 1970) and a threadbare opposition of 30 seats. The third party, Coalition Avenir Quebec, ended up with 23 % of the vote and 20 seats. Québec Solidaire got 3 seats and 7.6 % of the total vote.” Antonia Maioni – Department of Political Science  antonia.maioni [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Scotland’s Referendum “The Scottish Referendum of 2014 was one of the important events of the year, but not for the reasons usually given. It did not answer the question of separation once and for all. Rather, the promises made by the three main Westminster party leaders have not been fulfilled, and this is already causing resentment in Scotland. The issue is not dead because the British state is old and creasy, generally unable to reform itself.” John Hall – Department of Sociology john.anthony.hall [at] mcgill.ca (Email) Burger King and Tim Hortons’ merger “The proposed ""merger"" between Burger King and Tim Hortons has some interesting aspects to it.  On the surface, it looks like two food service companies of equal size getting together to create various economies of scale which lead to cost savings.  As well, it allows both companies to diversify their offerings to clients and thus enhance their revenue profile.  However, this deal has much more to do with the US tax system and the burgeoning practice of American companies doing a tax inversion by buying a foreign company and moving head offices abroad to a beneficial tax jurisdiction.” Ken Lester – Desautels Faculty of Management  klester [at] lesterasset.com (Email)   Contact Information Contact: Raphaël Larocque-Cyr Organization: Media Relations Office Email: raphael.larocque-cyr [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: 514-398-6693",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['2014', 'business', 'discovery', 'Ebola', 'Events', 'experts', 'External', 'Gaza', 'mcgill', 'News', 'Politics', 'Ukraine']"

UN Climate Change Conference - COP 20 - Experts,3 Dec 2014,"Published: 3Dec2014  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Dr James Ford and members of his McGill lab on climate change adaptation are now in Peru until Dec. 12 for the United Nations conference on climate change, where 195 countries have gathered to prepare a new global agreement on climate (unfccc.int/meetings/lima_dec_2014/meeting/8141.php). As climate change is already a reality, one of the key topics at the Conference is how countries around the globe are currently adapting to climate change and how effective their actions are. As experts on climate change adaptation, the Dr. Ford’s team (www.jamesford.ca) can comment on successful adaptation examples and the importance of working with local communities to implement solutions to climate change. This includes making room for these communities in international meetings such as UN conference. The McGill team will present their work with communities in Peru, the Canadian Artic, and Uganda to limit the damages of climate change. They focus on health threats induced by climate change, such as decrease in safe food and water supplies or increase in diseases spread by insects such as malaria. They study how communities can protect themselves. For example, as heavy rainfall and flooding in the Peruvian Amazon put certain communities at risk for water borne diseases, these communities adapt is by collecting rainwater.

Because bone loss occurs without symptoms, it is often referred to as “the silent thief”. Fractures from osteoporosis are most likely to occur in the wrist, spine, shoulder and hip and are more common than heart attack, stroke and breast cancer combined, with at least one in three women and one in five men expected to suffer from an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. Over 80% of all fractures in people 50+ are caused by osteoporosis. As of 2010, the annual cost to the Canadian health care system to treat osteoporosis was $2.3 billion. Some facts about osteoporosis: Osteoporosis causes 70-90% of the 30,000 hip fractures annually. Twenty-eight per cent of women and 37% of men who suffer a hip fracture will die within the following year. One in three hip fracture patients re-fracture at one year and over 1 in 2 will suffer another fracture within 5 year McGill expert:  Dr. David Goltzman Professor, Department of Medicine and Physiology, McGill University; Physician, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, MUHC Expertise: Co-Principal Investigator of the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (epidemiologic study looking at the demographics, causes, risk factors and outcomes of osteoporosis and of osteoporosis treatment in what were initially (the study started 16 years ago) 10,000 volunteers in 9 cities across Canada (they continue to follow about 4000).

Brazil Presidential Elections,5 Oct 2014,"Q+A with McGill Professor Philip Oxhorn  Published: 5Oct2014  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget                                  On October 5th, Brazilians will be asked to vote in presidential elections. All predictions are pointing in direction of a tight race between Dilma Rousseff, current president and candidate for the Worker’s Party, and Marina Silva, candidate for the Socialist Party.     Q: What are the important challenges that will be at the heart of this election? A: These are really big elections for Brazil. The reasons are multiple. First, the economy is slowing considerably - it is now in an official recession. Second, the Workers Party (PT) President may very well lose her second term. The PT has governed Brazil since Lula won in 2002. Dilma Rousseff was his heir designate, but she is not Lula in terms of charisma. Rousseff was seen as a policy person, but that image was tarnished by the lackluster economy and by corruption scandals linked with her positions before becoming president. She hasn't been accused of corruption, but corruption seems to have taken place under her watch. The latter also reinforced a growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and political ""insiders"", which brought hundreds of thousands of people out into the streets protesting a year before the World Cup. Then there was the World Cup, with Brazil's disappointing performance and the lack of any clear economic benefits, it only increased people's disillusionment. All of this will have an impact on the voters’ decision. Q: How did the death of Eduardo Campos affect this campaign? A: Marina Silva was going to be the vice-president in the campaign for an insider and he probably would have had a really difficult time winning. The reason is he doesn’t have the advantage of being an outsider, like Silva can claim. And don’t underestimate the organizational strength of the Worker’s Party. They will push full speed ahead to make sure they get up the vote. The biggest problem for Silva is that she lacks the organization that the current government has. It’s really a challenge for her, but her charisma plays in her favor. Q: Is Brazil in a better state then it was few years ago? A: Brazil is not a country facing food insecurity anymore, because food insecurity concerns less than 5% of its population. Job growth, and poverty reduction among other things are slowing down and no one knows how to reinvigorate those areas. In that context, people are in a better state, but they are still not happy, so they are focusing on what’s missing. Corruption is still an important topic, because there is so much waste, or the appearance of waste. And at the same time, when small things like a bus fare increase sets up a huge protest, it says a lot about what it means to be middle class in Brazil. A lot of things that were tolerable before are simply no longer. So the campaign is really more focusing on insiders vs outsiders. Then there are racial and social issues, because the woman challenging the Worker’s Party is an evangelist mixed race environmentalist, who comes from an even poorer background than Lula. She has her own type of charisma. You look at her and nothing really stands out, and then you hear her speak and the passion for what she has lived and what she believes in is just really compelling. Q: Does each leader target a specific audience? A: This is the irony. As much as Silva’s political formation is from her years in activism to support rain forest workers, but this is a small percentage of the population. They’re not likely to decide the vote. Yet the evangelicals easily could, and while she’s not identifying with any particular branch, everyone knows it’s in her background and the social stance of her party reflects it. She backtracked on same sex marriage and abortion. Yet when it comes to equity and environment, she is as progressive as anybody else. She is the kind of person that is calling for putting Brazil’s economy in order. So she’s calling for an end to corruption and a more sustainable fiscal policy. But part of the reason for the economic stagnation is bad economic policies. And what Silva is calling for is an independent central bank. This would be a big deal in South America since it means the government can’t set monetary policy, which is essential for maintaining stability. Q: So with Silva, Brazil has a much better shot at getting better? A: It’s hard to say. Symbolically though, Silva will leave a mark that Rousseff would never be able to.    Contact Information Contact: Raphael Larocque-Cyr Organization: Media Relations Office Email: raphael.larocque-cyr [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: 514-398-6693",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['Brazil', 'External', 'Politics', 'presidential election']"

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS): McGill expert,13 May 2014,"Published: 13May2014  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget                                The World Health Organization has scheduled an emergency meeting on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the wake of a second traveler to the U.S. having been diagnosed with (MERS) infection, health officials say. MERS is a respiratory illness that begins with flu-like fever and cough, but can lead to shortness of breath and pneumonia. MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003.   The MERS virus has been found in camels, but officials don't know how it is spreading to humans. It can spread from person to person, but officials believe that happens only after close contact. Not all those exposed to the virus become ill. It appears to be unusually lethal — by some estimates, it has killed nearly a third of the people it sickened. That's a far higher percentage than seasonal flu or other routine infections. But it is not as contagious as flu, measles or other diseases. There is no vaccine or cure and there's no specific treatment except to relieve symptoms.  Maziar Divangahi, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and an Associate Member, Dept.

For instance, we now know that these trillions of organisms play a critical role in everything from fighting off invading pathogens to contributing to diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and obesity. We are also learning how our diet can affect these microbes and in turn, the health of the immune system. On Dec. 2, McGill University and Immunology Montreal are inviting interested researchers, media representatives and members of the public to attend its 6th annual symposium where international experts will share the latest findings on this timely topic.

Media advisory: McGill hosts international conference on indigenous rights,10 Nov 2011,"Published: 10Nov2011  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget   Across the globe and across time, one of the most egregious historical dynamics has been the consistent denial of basic rights for indigenous peoples. On September 13, 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The fact that this nonbinding declaration took over 20 years to negotiate underscores both the importance of the Declaration’s adoption, as well as the extreme complexity of the challenges facing over 370 million people around the globe. On Nov. 17 and 18, 2011, the Institute for the Study of International Development (ISID) at McGill will host an international conference to examine the challenge of respecting the rights of indigenous peoples. The conference will bring together representatives of indigenous peoples from Africa, Latin America and North America, and key actors at the national and international levels in an effort to find practical solutions to problems of poverty, exclusion and victimization faced by indigenous peoples everywhere.

MEDIA ADVISORY: Putting alternative medicine under the microscope,3 Nov 2011,"Published: 3Nov2011  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget     Leading health experts to discuss non-conventional approaches at the Seventh Trottier Symposium Following 2010’s extremely successful Trottier Symposium on pseudoscience, this year’s event spotlights ""Alternative Medicine."" Four world-renowned experts have been invited to examine some of its tenets ""under the microscope."" Alternative medicine can be described as practices that are available to the public but which are not taught in conventional medical schools. The focus there lies on evidence-based methods and controlled experiments. Lack of evidence, however, does not mean that a particular treatment cannot work; there may be alternative methods and practices worth pursuing. Alternative treatments can range from acupuncture to reflexology, and its practitioners range from energy healers to magnet therapists and beyond. Although risks tend to be low, there is always the danger of patients being seduced by unsubstantiated claims, possibly to the extent of forgoing evidence-based treatments. Irrespective of one’s views on alternative medicine, there is no doubt that the subject merits attention and scrutiny. The seventh Trottier Symposium will feature two public events. On Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. at the Centre Mont-Royal (1000 Sherbrooke St. W.), Drs. Harriet Hall, Paul Offit and Robert Park will address the audience, while on Nov. 8 at 6 p.m., the floor will belong to Dr. Edzard Ernst at McGill’s Fieldhouse Auditorium. The Invited Speakers: Dr. Paul Offit - http://www.pauloffit.com. As the leading advocate of childhood immunizations in the United States, Dr. Offit is one of the most public figures speaking out against the alleged relationship between vaccines and autism. His 2008 book entitled Autism's False Prophets triggered attacks from the anti-vaccine movement and garnered support from vaccine advocates. Dr. Offit is the Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Dr. Harriet Hall - http://www.skepdoc.info/. Dr. Hall is a retired family physician who writes about pseudoscience and questionable medical practices. Dr. Hall is only the second woman to do her internship in the U.S. Air Force and was the first female graduate of the Air Force family practice residency at Elgin Air Force Base in Florida. As an Air Force physician, Dr. Hall did it all; she delivered babies, served as flight surgeon and even took the controls of a B-52. She retired as a full Colonel. Dr. Hall is an outspoken critic of alternative medicine and constantly emphasizes the importance of following scientific evidence. In 2008, Dr. Hall published an autobiography entitled, Women Aren’t Supposed to Fly:The Memoirs of a Female Flight Surgeon, a title that was inspired by the prejudiced comments of an airport official. Dr. Edzard Ernst is a former homeopathic practitioner and supporter of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). But Ernst has become a vocal critic of alternative medical techniques that are not supported by scientific evidence. Dr. Ernst co-wrote the best seller Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial with Simon Singh. He retired from the position of Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter this past summer, after producing more than 1,000 research papers. Dr. Robert (Bob) Park - http://www.skepdoc.info/. Dr. Park is Emeritus Professor of physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He has written op-eds and articles about space exploration, pseudoscience, alternative medicine, and the creation/evolution debate for the New York Times, Newsday, USA Today, and the Washington Post. Dr. Park has made frequent appearances on The Colbert Report, Dateline NBC, and NBC News discussing alternative medicine. He has also written two widely acclaimed books, Voodoo Science: The Road from foolishness to Fraud and Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science. A former Director of Public Information at the Washington office of the American Physical Society, Dr. Park has been a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry since 2004.

Relevant articles: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1762763# Terrorism and Human Rights: A Decade of Canadian Practices (2011): Almost a decade after 9/11, this paper seeks to assess the broad implications of the resurgence of fears about terrorism on the practice of human rights in Canada. It analyzes that impact from the point of view of an increased national security apparatus, modifications to the judicial process, and terrorism's role in framing human rights issues in a transnational light.

Canadian judges use international law principles in refugee issues, and ensure constitutional human rights protection to “everyone,” including refugees and asylum-seekers. Canada has expanded the refugee definition to persons at threat of torture, according to the United Nations Convention against Torture. But, on recent security issues, Canada has had difficulty to reconcile international law and domestic law, in terms of human rights guarantees. Return to torture has been technically rendered possible by the Supreme Court of Canada, as a matter of constitutional interpretation. One particular mechanism, the “security certificate,” has been intensely scrutinized by courts and found wanting in many cases. The secrecy surrounding the information on which the certificate is based has been criticized, as have been the ex parte proceedings, the indefiniteness of the detention, the limitations on the role of the “special advocate,” and so forth. Judges have felt increasingly irritated by the intrusion of security intelligence in judicial proceedings. Canada is (now more than before) reluctant to submit to international human rights scrutiny on migration and security issues, arguing that it relates to territorial sovereignty. The Stranger and the Right to Justice in Canada after the Events of September 11/(El Extranjero y el Derecho a la Justicia en Canadá tras el 11 de Septiembre) (Spanish) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1564858: After the events of September 11, the fear of terrorism led to the adoption of new anti-terrorist measures (elimination of appeals available to foreigners, reduction of legal aid, increased powers of detention, easier use of security certificates). But in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, only the right to vote and be elected, the right to enter and remain in the country and the minority language educational rights specifically protect citizens. The protection of Canadian citizens cannot be based on the denial of foreigner's rights. The same rights are at stake: the violation of a foreigner's rights is a violation of citizen's rights.

Tapping insights and controversies from feminist political theory, Lu argues that contemporary debates about the ethics of intervention in world politics are disciplined by competing models of the public/private distinction, a valuable organizing construct for interrogating the agency and responsibilities of different agents, the proper structure of their relationship with each other, and the legitimacy of current interventionary practices. This 2011 paperback edition includes a new afterword focusing on the Responsibility to Protect doctrine, and the ethical and political challenges it poses to diverse public and private agents engaged in interventions for purposes of human protection. This includes states and the United Nations, private military and security companies, and the international humanitarian aid regime.

Counting on bigger mining returns,26 May 2011,"Published: 26May2011  Facebook  LinkedIn Tweet Widget      Mining companies need to make long-term strategic plans about how and when to produce raw materials and metals from the ground, despite uncertainty about the mineral deposits to be found there. Because of computational advances over the last decade, McGill Professor Roussos Dimitrakopoulos, Canada Research Chair in Mining Engineering, has developed new mathematical modeling techniques for mine planning and production forecasting that take into account uncertainty in the supply of minerals. The result of this research has been both a much higher return on investment for the mining companies but also more metal production from the same asset. Now, thanks to a Collaborative Research and Development Grant of $2.7 million spread over five years from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and co-funded by six major global mining companies, Dimitrakopoulos will be able to build upon earlier research to produce global mine-optimization models which will be able to factor in uncertainty in all aspects of mine management in order to determine the best production schedules. The companies involved are Anglo Gold Ashanti, Barrick Gold, BHP Billiton, De Beers, Newmont and Vale. The models will be able to take into account multiple mines and material types; multiple ore/waste processing streams; and both stockpiles and products, while at the same time taking into account uncertainty in demand and hence in the commodity prices for minerals. The new uncertainty models of mine management will promote more sustainable development and use of mineral resources, while managing and reducing risks and maximizing the return on investment. Dr. Rose Goldstein, McGill’s Vice-Principal, Research and International Relations stresses the importance of this research and the benefit of collaboration and partnership between the granting agency, the university and industry, “This work will position McGill well, as a research and practical leader in this field, both in Canada and on a global scale. Given the importance of mining to the Canadian economy, we are very proud that Professor Dimitrakopoulos’ work is attracting this level of attention and support. We’d like to thank NSERC and each of our industrial partners for the funding which makes this research possible. In addition, thanks to the proviso that the research will be shared within a year, we are confident that the results will prove of significant benefit to the global mining community.” The unique and long-standing partnership of Prof. Dimitrakopoulos and his laboratory with the six mining companies, which together represent about 75 per cent of all mining activity on the globe, underscores the importance the research undertaken not only for Canada, but also for the global community as a whole. Indeed, one of the conditions of the NSERC award is that all partners have agreed that the developments will be placed in the public domain without restrictions within a year, so that the outcomes of the grant research will become accessible to both academics and practitioners around the world. “Dr. Dimitrakopoulos is an outstanding researcher with renowned expertise in the optimization of mining complexes,” said NSERC President Suzanne Fortier. “Given the importance of mining to the Canadian economy, his research has the potential to generate significant economic and environmental benefits for Canada, and to enhance our position as a world leader in this field.” The research is funded by Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)   Contact Information Contact: Katherine Gombay Organization: Media Relations Office, McGill University Email: katherine.gombay [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: 514 398-2189","['Expert alerts', 'Admin & governance', 'Research news', 'News releases', 'Research', 'Faculty of Science', 'Science Research', 'Research and innovation']",/newsroom,"['External', 'Faculty', 'Staff', 'Students']"

The 2011 Annual Lecture is also sponsored by the McGill Alumni Society and the Students’ Society of McGill University. About Carlos Fuentes Mr. Fuentes has always stood at the intersection of politics and art. As the leading figure in the Magical Realism movement, he helped establish Latin America’s most important artistic movement of the twentieth century. He studied law in Mexico City and Geneva, and in addition to his career as a literary giant, he served in several diplomatic positions, including as Mexico’s Ambassador to France. For more than fifty years, Mr. Fuentes’ works have challenged the social boundaries of Latin American societies. His commentary on justice has inspired millions around the world, and his books have been translated into dozens of languages. Mr. Fuentes’ personal history is nothing short of inspiring, and will be the basis for his lecture—how his knowledge of the law has added to his world renowned social perspective and ability to speak to the soul of his generation. As an academic, Mr. Fuentes has taught at many of the world’s premiere universities: Harvard, where he became the first Robert F. Kennedy Professor of Latin American Studies, Columbia, Cambridge (where he served as the Simón Bolívar Chair of Latin American Studies), the University of Paris, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Brown—where he currently holds the post of Professor-at-Large. In addition to his career as a novelist, he writes for El País, Spain’s highest circulating non-sports daily newspaper, and the Reforma newspaper in Mexico City. His newest book Destiny and Desire was released in early 2011. About the McGill Law Journal The McGill Law Journal was founded in 1952 by students of the Faculty of Law of McGill University. From its founding, the Journal has promoted the development of legal scholarship by appealing to an audience that includes professors of law, practicing lawyers, and law students. The Journal has consistently fostered a profound understanding of the common law and civil law legal traditions through the publication of cutting-edge articles. Today the Journal is recognized as an important forum for the critical analysis of contemporary legal issues, often from a comparative or transsystemic perspective. The publication remains entirely student-run. Every year the McGill Law Journal invites a distinguished speaker to deliver a scholarly address of significant contemporary interest to members of the McGill community, the Bar, the judiciary, and the general public. This annual event has attracted many notable speakers in years past including members of the judiciary, dignitaries, and legal scholars of international repute.             Contact Information Contact: Tamarah Feder Organization: Media Relations Office, McGill University Email: tamarah.feder [at] mcgill.ca Office Phone: 514 3998-6754",['Expert alerts'],/newsroom,"['External', 'Faculty', 'Staff', 'Students']"
